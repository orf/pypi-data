            "description": "# Telegram Factor Authentication - Python SDK\n\nIf you are using **TFA** as your authentication service in your python applications, you can use our library.\n\n## How to use the library\n\nSo, let's have a quick review of our steps.\n\n- Installation\n- Configuration\n- Checking result\n\n### Installation\n\nThe easiest step is installation. You can install it with `pip` or `pipenv`. Just go ahead and enter the command below:\n\n```shell\n$ pip3 install tfa-python-sdk\n```\n\nCongratulations! First step is done!\n\n### Configuration\n\nAfter installation, go to your file and import the library:\n\n```python\nfrom tfa_python_sdk import TFA\n```\n\nSecond, you need to epecify the **accecc_token**. You can get it in your dashboard panel. So, call the class:\n\n```python\nauth = TFA('access_token')\n```\n\nOk, now library know your access token. Now it's time to enter the **user_token**. User token is the code you get it from your form field or a post method. Importent is to get user token. So, we use `authUser` function to pass user token and get the result.\n\n```python\nresult = auth.authUser('user_token')\n```\n\nYou are done it this step. Let's move forward and check status codes and check user result.\n\n### Checking result\n\nWhen you get the result, you can check codes and see what are them. Here is a quick review:\n\n```python\nstatCode = result.error\n\nif (statCode == 800):\n    print('Authenticated.')\nelif (statCode == 820):\n    print('User token is wrong.')\nelif (statCode == 290):\n    print('Admin token is wrong.')\n```\n\nThis was just knowing status codes. If you don't know them now, check out our docs and read them, and know what are result of every status code.\n\nOk, 800 and 290 just return you an 2 lenght object. One is `error` and second is `message`. But 800 doesn't return you a `message`. You check the stat, if it was 800, second item is `user`. User item is the user data that **telegram uid** is stored there and you can use it.\n\n## More about status codes\n\nHere let's know about them in deep.\n\n- ### 800\n\n```json\n{\n    \"error\": 800,\n    \"user\": {\n        \"_id\": \"document id\",\n        \"uid\": \"telegram user id\",\n        \"token\": \"one time token. Every time become null\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"when created\",\n        \"updatedAt\": \"last update\",\n        \"__v\": 0\n    }\n}\n```\n\n- ### 820\n\n```json\n{\n    \"error\": 820,\n    \"message\": \"User authentication token is not valid\"\n}\n```\n\n- ### 290\n\n```json\n{\n    \"error\": 290,\n    \"message\": \"Admin access token is not valid\"\n}\n```\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to develop the library, it is so simple. Edit library codes and run `test.py` like this:\n\n```shell\n$ python3 test.py\n```\n\n> Before you start: **Remember the base or codes are stored in `tfa_python_sdk/tfa_python_sdk.py`. You need to edit there.\n\n",
