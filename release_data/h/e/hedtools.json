            "description": "# HEDTools - Python\nHED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors) is a framework for systematically describing\nboth laboratory and real-world events as well as other experimental metadata.\nHED tags are comma-separated path strings.\nHED, itself, is platform-independent, extendable, and data-neutral. \n\nThis repository contains the underlying python tools that support validation,\nsummarization, and analysis of datasets using HED tags.\nMost people will simply annotate their events by creating a spreadsheet\nor a BIDS JSON sidecar that associates HED tags with event codes or the events themselves.\nIf you have such a spreadsheet or a JSON, \nyou can use the HED Online Validator currently available at \n[https://hedtools.ucsd.edu/hed](https://hedtools.ucsd.edu/hed) to validate or transform\nyour files without downloading any tools.\n\n### Installation\nUse `pip` to install `hedtools` from PyPI:\n\n   ```\n       pip install hedtools\n   ```\n\nTo install directly from the \n[GitHub](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-python) repository:\n\n   ```\n       pip install git+https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-python/@master\n   ```\n\nThe HEDTools in this repository require python 3.7 or greater.\n\n### Relationship to other repositories\n\nThe `hed-python` repository contains the Python infrastructure for validating\nand analyzing HED. This repository has two companion repositories:\n- [`hed-web`](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-web) contains the web interface\nfor HED as well as a deployable docker module that supports web services for HED.\n- [`hed-examples`](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-examples) contains examples of\nusing HED in Python and MATLAB.\nThe site also contains many Jupyter notes illustrating\nvarious aspect of data curation and analysis using HED.\nThe site hosts HED test datasets and the HED user manuals.\n\n#### Develop versus master branches\n\nBecause the three repositories are interrelated, the following conventions are followed.\nThe latest stable version is on the master branches of `hed-python` and `hed-web` and the\n`main` branch of `hed-examples`.\nThe documentation link on `readthedocs` will describe the stable versions.\n\nAs features are integrated, they first appear in the `develop` branches of the\nthree repositories.\nThe `develop` branches of the three repositories will be kept in sync.\nIf an interface change in `hed-python` triggers a change in `hed-web` or `hed-examples`,\nevery effort will be made to get the stable branches of the respective repositories in\nsync.\n\n#### To contribute\n\nContributions are welcome.\nPlease use the [Github issues](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-python/issues)\nfor suggestions or bug reports.\nThe [Github pull request](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-python/pulls)\nmay also be used for contributions.\nUsually these updates should be made to the `develop` branch, not the `master`.\n\n\n### Other links of interest\n\nHED specification documentation: [https://hed-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://hed-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nExamples: [https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nDocumentation: [https://hed-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://hed-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nCode climate reports: [https://codeclimate.com/github/hed-standard/hed-python](https://codeclimate.com/github/hed-standard/hed-python).\n",
