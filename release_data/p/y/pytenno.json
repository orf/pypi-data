Python datatypes, attributes, etc.\n2. Asyncrhonous programming in Python (Coroutines, `async`, `await`)\n3. Fundamental understanding of context managers in Python (`async with`)\n4. How [warframe.market](https://warframe.market) works \n5. [Warframe](https://warframe.com/) mechanics\n\n## Examples\n\n### The Following Code Will Be Used in the Examples\n```python\n\nimport asyncio # To use asynchronous programming\nimport pytenno\nfrom pytenno.models.enums import Platform # To specify platforms for requests\n\nasync def main(): # PyTenno is asynchronous, so it must be done in an asynchronous context\n    default_language = \"en\" # Set default response language to English\n    default_platform = Platform.pc # Set default platform to PC\n\n    # Create a client with the default language and platform\n    # This must be done in an asynchronous context manager (async with ... [as ...])\n    async with pytenno.PyTenno(default_language, default_platform) as tenno:\n        ... # Example code goes here\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main()) # Create a new asyncio loop and run the coroutine\n```\n\n### Log into warframe.market\n```python\n        email = \"you@example.com\" # Email to account\n        password = \"password123\" # Password to account\n        current_user = await tenno.Auth.login(\n            email=email,\n            password=password\n        ) # Log in to warframe.market\n        # Note: the API stores absoloutely zero information about data passed. All code\n        # is open-source and available at https://github.com/ShadowMagic896/pytenno\n        print(current_user.ingame_name) # Print the ingame name of the user that was logged in\n```\n\n\n",
