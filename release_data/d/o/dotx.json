            "description": "## The Basic Idea\n\n### What `dotx` does; what it's _for_\n#### The problem\n\nYou're a software developer with tons of _dotfiles_: `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, `.tmux.conf`, `.inputrc`, and things living in\n`.config` just to name a few.  You have to install these on every system you work on **and** keep them up-to-date as\nthey change.  Without some special setup, there's no one source of truth, no easy deploy, no version control.  The\nobvious answer is to keep them in a `git` repo, but making your home directory _be_ that repo is no good.  And maybe you\ndon't even want them to live together.  Your `bash` files should be in a group, your `vim` files in a group, etc.\n\n#### A solution\n\nThe solution is obvious: keep them in a git repo, divided up into packages (or multiple `git` repos if you prefer), and\ninstall links in your home directory (or the _target_ directory) that point _into_ your `git` repo, at the source of\ntruth files.\n\nThe solution is so obvious in fact that of course there is already a `perl` tool called GNU `stow` that helps you do\nexactly that.  GNU `stow` has a feature that you can ask it to rename files that look like this: `\"dot-bashrc\"` to this\n`\".bashrc\"`.  This is incredibly helpful if, for instance, you want to edit your dotfiles on your iPad and your editor\nof choice can't see files or directories that start with a  `\".\"`.  Keeping your files in this form means no invisible\nfiles in your source repo so you can edit anywhere with anything.\n\nUnfortunately, GNU `stow` has a bug that its renaming feature doesn't work on directories.  And it's also a very general\npurpose tool.  It's made for installing a link-farm to any kind of package from anywhere to anywhere.\n\n`dotx` is a simple tool with a simple goal: manage a link-farm of possibly renamed links to dotfiles.  Yes, you can use\nit for other purposes, but it's tuned for its goal.\n\n### The user interface\n```\nUsage: dotx [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n  Manage a link farm: (un)install groups of links from \"source packages\".\n\nOptions:\n  --debug / --no-debug\n  --verbose / --quiet\n  --log FILE                Where to write the log (defaults to stderr)\n  --target DIRECTORY        Where to install (defaults to $HOME)\n  --dry-run / --no-dry-run  Just echo; don't actually (un)install.\n  -i, --ignore TEXT         a pattern to exclude from installation\n  --help                    Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  install    install [source-package...]\n  uninstall  uninstall [source-package...]\n```\nSo if you had a source package (a directory containing files) named `\"bash\"` containing `\"dot-bashrc\"` and\n`\"dot-bash_profile\"` you could install links to those two files (named `\".bashrc\"` and `\".bash_profile\"`) into your\n`${HOME}` directory by being in the parent of the source package and saying:\n```\ndotx install bash\n```\n### How it works\n\n\n\n### What's next\n",
