It is automated by default.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nTo configure automatic notifications, you need to:\n\n#. Go to *Settings*.\n#. Go to *Invoicing*.\n#. Choose if you want to *Require payment notifications*.\n#. Select the desired *Payment notification method*.\n#. Select the desired *Payment notifications automatism*.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use this module, you need to:\n\n#. Go to *Invoicing* or *Accounting* app.\n#. Go to *Customers > Payments* or *Vendors > Payments*.\n#. Select one or more payments.\n#. Click on *Action*.\n#. Select *Notify partners*.\n\nOdoo will use your preferred notification method, as defined in\nconfiguration (see that section), to notify all the chosen partners.\n\nBoth email and SMS notifications are put in outgoing queues. They will be\ncleared automatically when their corresponding cron jobs are executed.\n\nIf you do that same operation from a payment form view, you will have the option\nto choose between sending an email or an SMS. You will be able to edit the\ntemplate before sending it.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip: You have new filters in the payments list. Use them to select those\nthat have (or not) email or mobile phone.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f `Sending SMS is a paid service\n<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/applications/marketing/sms_marketing/pricing/pricing_and_faq.html>`__.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Multiple SMS notifications to the same partner cannot be sent in batch.\n  Always group payments before notifying. Odoo considers these SMS as duplicated\n  and avoids sending more than one per batch. This behavior is hardcoded.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-payment/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/account-payment/issues/new?body=module:%20account_payment_notification%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Moduon\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Rafael Blasco (`Moduon <https://www.moduon.team/>`__)\n* Jairo Llopis (`Moduon <https://www.moduon.team/>`__)\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-yajo| image:: https://github.com/yajo.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/yajo\n    :alt: yajo\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-yajo| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/account-payment <https://github.com/OCA/account-payment/tree/15.0/account_payment_notification>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
