            "description": "# auto-function-serving\n\nA python package to offload a function call to an http server running on localhost automatically using a decorator. Compatible with multiprocessing, pickle, flask, fastapi, async etc..\n\n## Why\n\nImagine a case of a multi threaded or multiprocessing application where 1 or few functions are heavily resource (cpu or memory) intensive, but the other functions can run in parallel.\\\nExample - an api call followed by tokenization and classification using a large DL model followed by further API calls.\\\nIn such a case, it would make sense to create a server (generally using torchserve or tfserving) to serve requests, and replace the function call with a post request to the server.\\\nServerHandler does this automatically during runtime. (Although it might be slower than a 'proper' server)\\\nAsyncServerHandler is also available which uses [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/) to make the requests async, for use with fastapi and other async use cases.\nAsyncServerHandler has the same usage as ServerHandler, except calls need to have await before it.\n \n## Reccomended Usage\nWhen the somemodule does not have any expensive global loading.\n```python\nfrom auto_function_serving.ServerHandler import ServerHandler\nfrom somemodule import someheavyfunction\nsomeheavyfunction = ServerHandler.decorator(someheavyfunction)\n```\nif there is some global loading\n```python\nfrom auto_function_serving.ServerHandler import ServerHandler\nsomeheavyfunction = ServerHandler(\"\"\"\nfrom somemodule import someheavyfunction\n\"\"\", \"someheavyfunction\")\n```\nAny calls to this new **someheavyfunction** will make requests to 1 instance of a process running a [http.server.HTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) which runs the function within it. Even calls made from different processes, threads, multiprocessing or servers like flask.\\\nIt can also be used like a traditional decorator for functions with no dependencies outside the function.\n```python\nfrom auto_function_serving.ServerHandler import ServerHandler\n@ServerHandler.decorator\ndef someheavyfunction(args,**kwargs):\n    for i in range(big_number)\n        someexpensivecomputation\n```\nimports inside the function will work\n```python\nfrom auto_function_serving.ServerHandler import ServerHandler\n@ServerHandler.decorator\ndef someheavyfunction(args,**kwargs):\n    import numpy as np\n```\n```python\nfrom auto_function_serving.ServerHandler import ServerHandler\n@ServerHandler.decorator\ndef someheavyfunction(args,**kwargs):\n\tif not hasattr(someheavyfunction,'RunOnce'):\n\tglobal np\n\timport numpy as np\n\tsetattr(someheavyfunction,'RunOnce',None)\n\t... etc\n```\nbut the better way to do it might be\n```python\nfrom auto_function_serving.ServerHandler import ServerHandler\nsomeheavyfunction = ServerHandler(\"\"\"\nimport numpy as np\ndef someheavyfunction(args,**kwargs):\n\tnp.ones(1000) \n\t...\n\"\"\", \"someheavyfunction\")\n```\n## Installation\n\nUse the package manager pip to install [auto_function_serving](https://pypi.org/project/auto-function-serving/)\n```bash\npip install auto_function_serving\n```\n\n## More Usage\nIn general : \n```\nsome independent code with a callable\n```\ncan be replaced with \n```python\nfrom auto_function_serving.ServerHandler import ServerHandler\ncallable_name = ServerHandler(\"\"\"\nsome independent code with a callable\n\"\"\", \"callable_name\")\n```\n\nExample :\n```python\nimport module1\nimport module2\ndef functionname(someinput):\n    a = module1.function1(someinput)\n    return module2.function2(a)\n```\ncan be replaced with\n```python\nfrom auto_function_serving.ServerHandler import ServerHandler\nfunctionname = ServerHandler(\"\"\"\nimport module1\nimport module2\ndef functionname(someinput):\n    a = module1.function1(someinput)\n    return module2.function2(a)\n\"\"\", \"functionname\")\n```\n# How does this work?\nCode for the server is stored in ServerHandler.base_code, inspect.cleandoc and some string formatting is used to fill in the blanks.\\\nA port from 50000 to 60000 is chosen by hashing the input text to make it independent of the source of a function. Collisions are possible, but unlikely. The port can be specified if needed.\n```python\nfrom somemodule import someheavyfunction\nfrom auto_function_serving.ServerHandler import ServerHandler\nsomeheavyfunction = ServerHandler.decorator(someheavyfunction, port = 4321)\n```\nServerHandler.ip_address is set as \"127.0.0.1\".\\\nThe server process is started with Popen (or multiprocessing if specified), and the first thing it does is import socket and bind the port - if it's not available the code stops after an exception. Therefore only 1 instance of the server runs at a time on a machine.\\\nWe know the function is ready after we can recieve a valid get request from the server.\\\nInputs and outputs are sent as bytes, converted to and from objects using pickle.\n\n## Performance (On my machine)\noverhead for small input and output (few bytes) - \\\n~2ms for requests with urllib.request\\\n~5ms for async requests with aiohttp.ClientSession \\\noverhead for large input and output\\\n~10ms for 0.5 mb input and output (1mb total transfer).\\\n~60ms for 5 mb input and output (10 mb total transfer).\\\n~600ms for 50 mb input and output (100 mb total transfer).\n\n## Other things to look into\nLibraries : Celery, Tfserving, Torchserve, Flask\\\nSending globals and locals to exec\\\nast trees\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests are welcome.\n\n## License\n[Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)\n",
