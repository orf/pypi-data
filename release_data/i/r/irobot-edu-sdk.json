            "description": "# iRobot\u00ae Education Python\u00ae SDK\n\nThis is an installable Python SDK for the iRobot Education robots.\nIt supports the iRobot\u00ae Root\u00ae rt0, Root\u00ae rt1 and Create\u00ae 3 educational robots.\n\nThis SDK uses a similar format as Learning Level 3 of the iRobot\u00ae Coding App ([code.irobot.com](https://code.irobot.com)) and the iRobot\u00ae Python Web Playground ([python.irobot.com](https://python.irobot.com)).\nAs such, it uses async execution and is compatible with Python\u00ae 3.9 or greater. MicroPython may work, but it is not tested.\n\nThis SDK is designed to communicate with robots via Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy on Windows\u00ae, macOS\u00ae, and Linux\u00ae systems.\nExperimental backends are provided for communicating over USB serial and USB on MicroPython boards with native USB ports.\nThese are not currently supported.\n\n## Disclaimer: this is a BETA release.\nThe BETA version of the iRobot\u00ae Python SDK is provided \u201cas is\u201d to conduct testing and gather user feedback. There is no guarantee on its performance or compatibility, continued availability, or on a timeline for improvements.\n\nPlease do file [issues](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot-edu-python-sdk/issues) as they are found, so that the team (or the community) can address them.\n\n\n## Installation using pip\n\n```\npip3 install irobot_edu_sdk\n```\n\n\n## Optional: Installation from Source\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot-edu-python-sdk.git\n```\n\nFrom the newly cloned SDK's directory, run:\n\n```\npip3 install .\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nA robot object is created from one of the communication backends.\nThis robot object has a number of event callbacks that can be registered and commands that can be sent to the robot.\nAfter a program is setup, the `play()` method will start execution and block until the robot's nose or power button is pressed, the robot is disconnected, or `Ctrl-C` is pressed.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nA good way of getting started is by looking at the examples provided [here](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/irobot-edu-python-sdk/tree/main/examples).\n\nThese examples mirror the iRobot Education [Python Web Playground](http://python.irobot.com).\n\n## Backend\n\n### Bluetooth\n\niRobot Education's robots communicate using a common Bluetooth Low Energy serial protocol, the details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/root-robot-ble-protocol).\n\n```python\nfrom irobot_edu_sdk.backend.bluetooth import Bluetooth\n\n# Connect to robot over Bluetooth Low Energy.\nbackend0 = Bluetooth('') # Connects to the first BLE robot detected.\nbackend1 = Bluetooth('ROOT') # Use robot named 'ROOT'\n```\n\n## ALPHA features\n**The features detailed below are included as ALPHA versions, which provide limited functionality and are likely to contain several known or unknown bugs.**\n**Support is not provided for ALPHA features at this time.**\n\n### Serial\n\nSome Root\u00ae robots support a serial port over USB.\n\n```python\nfrom irobot_edu_sdk.backend.serial import Serial\n\n# Connect to robot over USB-C cable.\nbackend = Serial('COM1')                          # Windows\nbackend = Serial('/dev/cu.usbmodemRT0123F456789') # macOS\nbackend = Serial('/dev/ttyACM0')                  # Linux\n```\n\n### MicroPython\n\nThis SDK requires MicroPython firmware that includes the `uasyncio` library -- version 1.13 or greater.\nDownload the latest release for your board from http://micropython.org/download.\nThen, copy the `irobot_edu_sdk` directory and all contents to the `PYBFLASH` drive.\n\n```python\nfrom irobot_edu_sdk.backend.usb import USB\n\n# Connect to robot from MicroPython-compatible board over USB.\nbackend = USB() # MicroPython-compatible board is powered from USB-C port\n```\n\nNOTE: You may need to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter or a USB-C to micro USB cable.\n\n**\u00a9 2022 iRobot Corporation.
