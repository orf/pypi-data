I have not included them in this repository as ASAM requires you enter your details to access them, so I assume they don't want them publically distributed through any means other than their own website. You can access them [here](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/).\n\nYou can also test on the networks for the OpenSCENARIO example files, obtainable [here](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/openscenario/).\n\nOnce you've downloaded these files, create an `example_networks` subdirectory under `tests` and place them there.\n```bash\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pyxodr\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 geometries\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 road_objects\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tests\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 example_networks\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Ex_Lane-Border\n    \u2502   \u2502   ...\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 UC_Simple-X-Junction-TrafficLights\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 output_plots\n```\nand then you should be able to run the (Pytest) tests as normal:\n```bash\npytest tests\n```\n\nNote: with version 1.7.0 of the OpenDRIVE spec, the `Ex_LHT-Complex-X-Junction` file throws a connection position `ValueError` on plotting with this module. I think this is due to a mistake in the file; older versions of this file work without throwing an error, and I believe that the direction of the reference line of road `id==3` was reversed without swapping the corresponding `contactPoint`(s) - e.g. in road `id==34`, where it is listed as a successor with `contactPoint==\"start\"` despite the reference lines now traveling in opposite directions. If I'm incorrect about this and this is an error with the code, please raise an issue.\n\n## TODO\n\nLarge components of the OpenDRIVE spec are not currently supported, including:\n- Super Elevation / Road Shape (8.4.2 & 8.4.3)\n- Road surfaces (8.5)\n- Road markings (9.6)\n- Junction groups (10.7)\n- Objects (11)\n- Signals (12)\n- Railroads (13)\n- `elementDir` / `elementS` for road & junction linking.\n\nSome of these will be supported in the future. Pull requests implementing (or partially implementing) any of these are welcome. Additionally if you find anything else unsupported by this repo which is not covered by the above list (and there will be lots), please raise an issue.\n",
