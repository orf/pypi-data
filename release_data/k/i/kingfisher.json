It's input is an \"Run\" accession e.g. DRR001970.\n\nIt attempts to download data from a series of methods, which it attempts in order until one works. Then the downloaded data is converted to an output SRA / FASTQ / FASTA / GZIP file format as required. Both download and extraction phases are usually quicker than using the NCBI's SRA toolkit.\n\nThis software was originally known as `ena-fast-download`. Kingfisher implements\nalmost all of that tool's functionality, but also handles data sources other\nthan ENA. See the 'Usage' section for the equivalent invocation.\n\nThe `ena-ascp` method of this tool was built based on the very helpful bio-stars\nthread https://www.biostars.org/p/325010/ written by @ATpoint. To find run\nidentifiers to be used as input to kingfisher, you might find the [SRA\nexplorer](https://ewels.github.io/sra-explorer/) site helpful.\n\n## Installation\n\nKingfisher can be installed by installing its conda dependencies as follows\n\n```\nconda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n kingfisher pigz python extern curl sra-tools\nconda activate kingfisher\ngit clone https://github.com/wwood/kingfisher-download\ncd kingfisher-download/bin\nexport PATH=$PWD:$PATH\nkingfisher -h\n```\n\nOptionally, to use the `ena-ascp` method, an Aspera connect client is also required.\nSee https://www.ibm.com/aspera/connect/ or https://www.biostars.org/p/325010/\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nkingfisher get -r ERR1739691 -m ena-ascp aws-http prefetch\n```\nThis will download `.fastq.gz` files of the run ERR1739691 from the ENA, or\nfailing that, downloads an .sra file from the Amazon AWA Open Data Program and\nthen converts to FASTQ, or failing that use NCBI prefetch to download and\nconvert that to FASTQ.\n\nOutput files are put into the current working directory.\n\n### Method details\n\n|__method__ |__description__ |\n| --- | --- |\n|`ena-ascp`|Download `.fastq.gz` files from ENA using Aspera, which can then be further converted. This is the fastest method since no `fasterq-dump` is required.|\n|`ena-ftp`|Download `.fastq.gz` files from ENA using `curl`, which can then be further converted. This is relatively fast since no `fasterq-dump` is required.|\n|`prefetch`|Download .SRA file using NCBI's prefetch from sra-tools, which is then extracted with `fasterq-dump`.|\n|`aws-http`|Download .SRA file from AWS Open Data Program using `curl`, which is then extracted with `fasterq-dump`.|\n|`aws-cp`|Download .SRA file from AWS using `aws s3 cp`, which is then extracted with fasterq-dump. May require payment, probably not.|\n|`gcp-cp`|Download .SRA file from Google Cloud `gsutil`, which is then extracted with fasterq-dump. Requires payment.|\n\n### Near parity with ena-fast-download\n\nEna-fast-download was the original name for this tool. To imitate that tool's\nfunctionality:\n\n```\nkingfisher get -r ERR1739691 -m ena-ascp\n```\n\n## FAQ\nIf you see this error `/bin/sh: 1: ascp: not found` as below:\n```\n$ kingfisher get -r ERR3357550 -m ena-ascpkingfisher -r ERR3357550 -m ena-ascp\n05/04/2021 05:13:45 AM INFO: Attempting download method ena-ascp ..\n05/04/2021 05:13:45 AM INFO: Using aspera ssh key file: $HOME/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh\n05/04/2021 05:13:45 AM INFO: Querying ENA for FTP paths for ERR3357550..\n05/04/2021 05:13:49 AM INFO: Downloading 2 FTP read set(s): ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR335/000/ERR3357550/ERR3357550_1.fastq.gz, ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR335/000/ERR3357550/ERR3357550_2.fastq.gz\n05/04/2021 05:13:49 AM INFO: Running command: ascp -T -l 300m -P33001  -i $HOME/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh era-fasp@fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR335/000/ERR3357550/ERR3357550_1.fastq.gz .\n/bin/sh: 1: ascp: not found\n05/04/2021 05:13:49 AM WARNING: Error downloading from ENA with ASCP: Command 'ascp -T -l 300m -P33001  -i $HOME/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh era-fasp@fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR335/000/ERR3357550/ERR3357550_1.fastq.gz .' returned non-zero exit status 127.\n05/04/2021 05:13:49 AM WARNING: Method ena-ascp failed\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./bin/kingfisher\", line 330, in <module>\n    raise Exception(\"No more specified download methods, cannot continue\")\nException: No more specified download methods, cannot continue\n```\nthen you have not installed the Aspera client correctly.
