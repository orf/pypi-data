            "description": "# Maialib - Music Analysis Library\n\nThis library is a multiplatform set of musical tools that enable musical score analisys and composition in a easy and fast way. <br>\nThe project **core** was wrote in `C++17`, but it also has a `Python` wrapper that allows a greater number of people (ie musicians not trained in IT) to also have in their hands the same power and musical tools available in `maialib`.\n\n## Advantages\n- Easy to use to musicians and musical researchers\n- High computer perfomance and fast calculations\n- Read and write musical scores (MusicXML file format)\n\nYou can easily import your sheet music to Python environment using:\n```python\nfrom maialib import * \n\nscore = Score('examples/Beethoven/Symphony_9th.xml')\n```\n\nNow you can explore some `maialib` features like:\n\n- Find musical patterns\n- Write your own scores from your custom algorithms\n- Analyse scores in a musical statistical data perspective\n- And much more! \n\n## Requirements\n### To run-only\n- Python 3.7 (or greater)\n\n### To build from source\n- C++17 compatible compiler\n- CMake 3.0\n- Python 3.7\n- Make\n- Doxygen (Optional: To build documentation)\n\n## Tested Environments\n\nOperational System | Compilers\n------------------ | ----------------\nWindows 10 x64     | GCC 10.3 (MSYS2) <br> Visual Studio 2022\nLinux Ubuntu 20.04 | GCC 9.3\nApple OSX 10.15    | XCode (Command Line Tools) 11.5\n\n## Documentation\nThis project have 2 documentation levels. One for each user type:\n- **Level 1 - User documentation:** for musicians, musical researchers and non-professional IT people\n- **Level 2 - Developer documentation:** A deeper information for professional C++ programmers\n\n### Level 1: Python Tutorial\nYou can explore `maialib` features looking at `python-tutorial` folder. <br>\nThere you will learn how to use and mix `maialib` classes and functions to reach your musical goals\n\n### Level 2: Developer Documentation\nYou can browse the compiled `doxygen` documentation opening `docs/index.html`. <br>\n\n## Quick Start\n### Build Python module from C++ source\nOpen a terminal (or CMD in Windows), enter inside of the `maialib` folder. <br>\nType: `make` to build the Python module <br>\nWhen the build process finishes, type: `make install` <br>\nDone!\n\n## Frequent Asked Questions\n### 1) Where can I find the XML file of a specific musical score?\n\nTo import musical scores the file extensions must be: `*.xml`, `*.mxl` or `*.musicxml` <br>\nYou can easily export your music files to these file formats above from score editors, like:\n\n- MuseScore (free!)\n- Sibelius\n- Finale\n- Others\n\nMany `MusicXML` files are avaliable for free in the internet for download.\nBut if you don't have a specific MusicXML file, you can import the MIDI file in a score editor (like MuseScore) and then export the `MusicXML` file from it.\n\n## Known issues to build from source\n### All Platforms\n- Multiple Python versions installed, like: `Official Python`, `Microsoft Python`, `MSYS2 Python` and others can direct the build system to choose a wrong version to build and install the library. <br>\nTo check all Python versions installed on your system, open the `Terminal` (or `CMD` on Windows) and type:\n    - Linux or Mac:\n        - `which python`\n        - `which python3`\n    - Windows:\n        - `where.exe python`\n        - `where.exe python3`\n\n### Windows-Only\n- Disable your antivirus or create a exception (CMake permissions)\n\n## Contact\nNycholas Maia - nyckmaia@gmail.com\n\n## Contributing\nIf you want...\n\n## License\nMaialib is licensed under (GPLv3 License) [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html]\n\n\n\n",
