This package implements distributed computing by communication backend like MPI, NCCL, MQTT, gRPC, PyTorch RPC, and also supports topology management. \nOther low-level APIs related to security and privacy are also supported. All algorithms and Scenarios are built based on the \"core\" package.\n\n**data**: FedML will provide some default datasets for users to get started. Customization templates are also provided.\n\n**model**: FedML model zoo.\n\n**device**: FedML computing resource management.\n\n**simulation**: FedML parrot can support: (1) simulate FL using a single process (2) MPI-based FL Simulator (3) NCCL-based FL Simulator (fastest)\n\n**cross-silo**: Cross-silo Federated Learning for cross-organization/account training\n\n**cross-device**: Cross-device Federated Learning for Smartphones and IoTs\n\n**distributed**: Distributed Training: Accelerate Model Training with Lightweight Cheetah\n\n**serve**: Model serving, tailored for edge inference\n\n**mlops**: APIs related to machine learning operation platform (open.fedml.ai)\n\n**centralized**: Some centralized trainer code examples for benchmarking purposes.\n\n**utils**: Common utilities shared by other modules.\n\n## About FedML, Inc.\nhttps://FedML.ai\n\n\n",
