It is builded using state-of-the-art python frameworks. pyJedAI constitutes the sole open-source Link Discovery tool that is capable of exploiting the latest breakthroughs in Deep Learning and NLP techniques, which are publicly available through the Python data science ecosystem. This applies to both blocking and matching, thus ensuring high time efficiency, high scalability as well as high effectiveness, without requiring any labelled instances from the user.\n\n### Key-Features\n\n- Input data-type independent. Both structured and semi-structured data can be processed.\n- Various implemented algorithms.\n- Easy-to-use.\n- Utilizes some of the famous and cutting-edge machine learning packages.\n<!-- - Offers supervised and unsupervised ML techniques. -->\n\n__Open demo python notebook:__\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://nbviewer.org/github/AI-team-UoA/pyJedAI/blob/main/tutorials/Demo.ipynb\">\n        <img align=\"center\" src=\"https://nbviewer.org/static/img/nav_logo.svg\" width=120/> \n    </a>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/AI-team-UoA/pyJedAI/blob/main/tutorials/Demo.ipynb\">\n        <img align=\"center\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Edn_LpbSpLeNKfWkEdG2Jg.png\" width=120/> \n    </a>\n</div>\n\n<br> \n\nFor more tutorials go to [pyJedAI/tutorials](https://github.com/AI-team-UoA/pyJedAI/tree/main/tutorials).\n\n# Install\n\nInstall the latest version of pyjedai __[requires python >= 3.7]__:\n```\npip install pyjedai\n```\n\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: [AI-team-UoA/pyJedAI](https://github.com/AI-team-UoA/pyJedAI).\n\n\n# Dependencies\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Pandas_logo.svg/2560px-Pandas_logo.svg.png\" width=120/> &nbsp;&nbsp;\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/NumPy_logo_2020.svg/1280px-NumPy_logo_2020.svg.png\" width=120/> &nbsp;&nbsp;\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://logoeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/python-logo-vector.png\" width=120/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Jupyter_logo.svg/883px-Jupyter_logo.svg.png\" width=70/>  <br>\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optuna/optuna/master/docs/image/optuna-logo.png\" width=150/>\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Plotly_logo_for_digital_final_%286%29.png/1200px-Plotly_logo_for_digital_final_%286%29.png\" width=150/>\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://www.fullstackpython.com/img/logos/scipy.png\" width=150/>  <br><br>\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://www.kornosk.me/resources/language-model/featured.png\" width=150/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/1349775/202c4680-8f7c-11e9-91c6-745fdcbeffe8\" width=150/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://networkx.org/_static/networkx_logo.svg\" width=150/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RDFLib/OWL-RL/master/OWL-RL.png\" width=70/> \n</div>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nSee the full list of dependencies and all versions used, in this [file](https://github.com/AI-team-UoA/pyJedAI/blob/main/requirements.txt).\n\n# Bugs, Discussions & News\n\n[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AI-team-UoA/pyJedAI/discussions) is the discussion forum for general questions and discussions and our recommended starting point.
