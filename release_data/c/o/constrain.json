We envision that literate programming for biology \ncan be adapted for any experimental workflow and be mixed and matched for the \nbenefit of the user. As this tool is built to be flexible through its open-source\nPython platform, future repetitive tasks can be automated and thus increase \nthe speed at which we engineer biology. \n\nCurious about how you can build strains easier and faster? Head over to our `Google Colab notebooks <https://github.com/hiyama341/ConStrain/tree/main/colab_notebooks>`__\nand give it a try.\n\nPlease cite our paper (link tba) if you've used ConStrain in a scientific publication.\n\n.. summary-end\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Combinatorial library generation\n* HT cloning and transformation workflows\n* Flowbot One instructions\n* CSV-based LIMS system as well as integration to Benchling\n* Genotyping of microbial strains\n* Advanced Machine Learning of biological datasets with the AutoML `H2O <https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html>`__\n* Workflows for selecting enzyme homologs\n* Promoter selection workflows from RNA-seq datasets\n* Data analysis of large LC-MS datasets along with workflows for analysis\n\n\n..  image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hiyama341/ConStrain/main/pictures/DBTL_ConStrain_with_modules1.svg\n    :width: 800\n    :alt: Overview of ConStrain's features throughout the DBTL cycle. \n\nGetting started\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTo get started with making microbial strains in an HT manner please follow the steps below: \n\n1. Install ConStrain. You will find the necessary information below for installation.\n\n2. Check out our `notebooks <https://github.com/hiyama341/ConStrain/tree/main/colab_notebooks>`__ for inspiration to make HT strain construction with ConStrain.\n\n3. You can start making your own workflows by importing ConStrain into either Google colab or Jupyter lab/notebooks.\n\n\nColab notebooks\n---------------\nAs a proof of concept we show how ConStrain and literate programming can be used to streamline bioengineering workflows.\nThese workflows should serve as a guide or a help to build your own workflows and thereby harnessing the power of literate programming with ConStrain. \n\nSpecifically, in this study we present how ConStrain and literate programming to build simulation-guided, iterative,\nand evolution-guided laboratory workflows for optimizing strictosidine production in yeast.\n\nBelow you can find all the notebooks developed in this work.
