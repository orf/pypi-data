And while there is no guarantee which guns will be in the battle pass, it always gives you around 9 to 12 gun skins. These skins come in sets of 3. So there is a good chance you will get a Spectre skin. But the catch of a battle pass is just buying the battle pass won\u2019t get you the Spectre skin. You will have to grind to earn the XP needed to reach the tier where you can unlock the Spectre skin. So to sum it up.\r\n \r\n\r\nClick Here --> https://wikiredeem.com/valorant/\r\n\r\nClick Here --> https://wikiredeem.com/valorant/\r\n\r\n## [ valorant free points 3500 ](https://wikiredeem.com/valorant/) \r\n\r\n================================================\r\n\r\nHowever, you should not use the free Valorant Points Generator to create your own skin economy, as Riot Games don\u2019t want their users to have an over-inflated skin economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n## valorant free points 3500\r\n\r\nBy submitting your work to Riot Games, you will be eligible to get up to 50 free Valor Points. This is a promotional offer that will assist you in gaining some VP at no cost whatsoever. However, in order to do so, you will need to make a drawing or illustration that would please Riot Games. Here's all you need to know about taking part in content.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALORANT is a shooting game, and you'll spend a lot of time looking at your weapons. Nothing would make more sense than using exclusive weapon skins as the primary source of customization. You can get them in the store, through Contracts and the Battle Pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n## [ valorant free points 3500 ](https://wikiredeem.com/valorant/)",
