Instead, this library always assumes those defaults and I \ncan still customize by passing different configurations when getting a logger or\nby using the methods of the built-in `logging` library after getting a logger.\n\nThe usage is quite evident from reading the code, and small enough so to prevent\nme from wanting to duplicate that here (for now).\n",
