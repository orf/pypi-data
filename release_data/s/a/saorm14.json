SQLAlchemy provides a full suite\nof well known enterprise-level persistence patterns,\ndesigned for efficient and high-performing database\naccess, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain\nlanguage.\n\nMajor SQLAlchemy features include:\n\n* An industrial strength ORM, built\n  from the core on the identity map, unit of work,\n  and data mapper patterns.   These patterns\n  allow transparent persistence of objects\n  using a declarative configuration system.\n  Domain models\n  can be constructed and manipulated naturally,\n  and changes are synchronized with the\n  current transaction automatically.\n* A relationally-oriented query system, exposing\n  the full range of SQL's capabilities\n  explicitly, including joins, subqueries,\n  correlation, and most everything else,\n  in terms of the object model.\n  Writing queries with the ORM uses the same\n  techniques of relational composition you use\n  when writing SQL.  While you can drop into\n  literal SQL at any time, it's virtually never\n  needed.\n* A comprehensive and flexible system\n  of eager loading for related collections and objects.\n  Collections are cached within a session,\n  and can be loaded on individual access, all\n  at once using joins, or by query per collection\n  across the full result set.\n* A Core SQL construction system and DBAPI\n  interaction layer.  The SQLAlchemy Core is\n  separate from the ORM and is a full database\n  abstraction layer in its own right, and includes\n  an extensible Python-based SQL expression\n  language, schema metadata, connection pooling,\n  type coercion, and custom types.\n* All primary and foreign key constraints are\n  assumed to be composite and natural.  Surrogate\n  integer primary keys are of course still the\n  norm, but SQLAlchemy never assumes or hardcodes\n  to this model.\n* Database introspection and generation.  Database\n  schemas can be \"reflected\" in one step into\n  Python structures representing database metadata;\n  those same structures can then generate\n  CREATE statements right back out - all within\n  the Core, independent of the ORM.\n\nSQLAlchemy's philosophy:\n\n* SQL databases behave less and less like object\n  collections the more size and performance start to\n  matter; object collections behave less and less like\n  tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter.\n  SQLAlchemy aims to accommodate both of these\n  principles.\n* An ORM doesn't need to hide the \"R\".   A relational\n  database provides rich, set-based functionality\n  that should be fully exposed.   SQLAlchemy's\n  ORM provides an open-ended set of patterns\n  that allow a developer to construct a custom\n  mediation layer between a domain model and\n  a relational schema, turning the so-called\n  \"object relational impedance\" issue into\n  a distant memory.\n* The developer, in all cases, makes all decisions\n  regarding the design, structure, and naming conventions\n  of both the object model as well as the relational\n  schema.   SQLAlchemy only provides the means\n  to automate the execution of these decisions.\n* With SQLAlchemy, there's no such thing as\n  \"the ORM generated a bad query\" - you\n  retain full control over the structure of\n  queries, including how joins are organized,\n  how subqueries and correlation is used, what\n  columns are requested.  Everything SQLAlchemy\n  does is ultimately the result of a developer-initiated \n  decision.\n* Don't use an ORM if the problem doesn't need one.\n  SQLAlchemy consists of a Core and separate ORM\n  component.   The Core offers a full SQL expression\n  language that allows Pythonic construction\n  of SQL constructs that render directly to SQL\n  strings for a target database, returning\n  result sets that are essentially enhanced DBAPI\n  cursors.\n* Transactions should be the norm.  With SQLAlchemy's\n  ORM, nothing goes to permanent storage until\n  commit() is called.  SQLAlchemy encourages applications\n  to create a consistent means of delineating\n  the start and end of a series of operations.\n* Never render a literal value in a SQL statement.\n  Bound parameters are used to the greatest degree\n  possible, allowing query optimizers to cache\n  query plans effectively and making SQL injection\n  attacks a non-issue.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nLatest documentation is at:\n\nhttps://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/\n\nInstallation / Requirements\n---------------------------\n\nFull documentation for installation is at\n`Installation <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/intro.html#installation>`_.\n\nGetting Help / Development / Bug reporting\n------------------------------------------\n\nPlease refer to the `SQLAlchemy Community Guide <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/support.html>`_.\n\nCode of Conduct\n---------------\n\nAbove all, SQLAlchemy places great emphasis on polite, thoughtful, and\nconstructive communication between users and developers.\nPlease see our current Code of Conduct at\n`Code of Conduct <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/codeofconduct.html>`_.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSQLAlchemy is distributed under the `MIT license\n<https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.\n\n\n\n",
