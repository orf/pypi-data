An example of this path in windows is :\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\user\\otherPipProj\\otherpipENV\\Lib\\site-packages\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll these file paths are available on all OS,you can make a bit of google search to know exactly how to find these file paths in your PC.\r\n\r\nAfter all is set,viola! you're ready to use prypip \ud83e\udd73 .\r\n\r\nPrypip can be used on the command line with the root command ``` prypip ``` .\r\n\r\nTo install a package you can use :\r\n\r\n```\r\nprypip run pip install <package_name>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will perform the regular pip install function with the added fuctionality of updating your requirements.txt automatically.\r\n\r\nNote: Make sure you're within the root directory of your project which is where the requirements.txt file usually resides.\r\n\r\nOther commands and examples include:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nprypip run pip uninstall <package_name>  [<automatically removes a package from requirements.txt when pip uninstalls a package>]\r\n\r\nprypip run pip install <package_name> --upgrade [<automatically updates the version of the upgraded package in requirements.txt>]\r\n\r\nprypip open dependency_tree.json [<this command opens the dependency_tree.json file(check api reference for more) and displays every package with their dependencies in a tree structure>]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## API Reference\r\n\r\n``` venv_py_path.txt ``` : file created by user to store virtual environment's python interpreter path and site-packages\r\npath.\r\n\r\n``` dependency_tree.json ``` : file that stores each installed package as a key and every sub packages that it requires\r\n(packages in which the installed package depends on) as value in a dict then converted to json.\r\n\r\n``` prypip ``` : The main command for working with prypip.\r\n\r\n``` run ``` : used to specify execution of commands external to prypip e.g pip\r\n\r\n``` open ``` : used for opening and displaying special documents in prypip, e.g ``` prypip open dependency_tree.json ```\r\ndisplays tthe content of dependency_tree.json in a tree like structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
