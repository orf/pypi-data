            "description": "About\n-----\n\npycms is a minimalist component based web content management system\nbuilt upon CherryPy.\n\nFeatures:\n\n-  All the goodies of Plone/Zope: Python instead of a PHP security mess,\n   no MySQL can of worms, clean separation of code and content, runs\n   nicely behind a web server / cache / load balancer.\n\n-  Plain text storage of all site contents and settings in JSON files.\n\n-  Effortless theming. Design an HTML page in your favourite editor, put\n   in some ``$placeholder_variables``, and upload. pycms cares for the\n   rest.\n\n-  Small memory footprint. We're talking about 13 MB physical memory.\n\npycms is aiming at frustrated Plone users (and is being developed by\none). Plone is an excellent CMS, but it has several severe shortcomings:\n\n-  Plone/Zope is extremly difficult to manage, especially to update,\n   when relying on unstable third-party plugins. Yes, one should not use\n   them, yet we all do, since those extensions often add vital\n   functionality.\n\n-  Plone/Zope puts all contents into an object database. Accessing and\n   changing the raw data, bypassing the CMS, is only possible via\n   cumbersome command-line work. And we're not talking at all about\n   manually fixing broken plugins in the database.\n\n-  Theming Plone is a mess. To reproduce a preconceived design in Plone,\n   long-winded CSS hacks along with a combination of interface settings\n   and template customisations are required.\n\n-  Plone/Zope has a comparatively large memory footprint. This can be an\n   issue on slim virtual servers.\n\nPlone is still a great system. Its security track record,\ninternationalisation, and workflow tools are awesome. If you have a big\nsite with complex requirements, go for it.\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\nPython > 3.0 http://www.python.org\n\nCherryPy http://cherrypy.org/\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThere is no installation necessary. Simply run\n\n::\n\n    python3 -m pycms.run\n\nfrom the pycms folder.\n\nCommand Line Options\n--------------------\n\n::\n\n    Usage: pycms.py [options]\n\n    Options:\n      --version             show program's version number and exit\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      -p PORT, --port=PORT  The port to listen on. Default: 8000\n      -t THREADS, --threads=THREADS\n                            The number of worker threads to start. Default: 10\n      -a, --autoreload      Turn on CherryPy's auto reloading feature.\n\nTemplates\n---------\n\npycms templates are plain and valid HTML files, for the ease of editing.\n\n``<body>`` and ``<link>`` tags must be the first tags on a single line\nin the HTML file.\n\npycms recognises special elements wrapped in HTML comments like this:\n\n::\n\n    <!-- begin TYPE -->\n    ... HTML, possibly with $variables ...\n    <!-- end TYPE -->\n\nWhere TYPE is one of\n\n-  node\n-  wrappednode\n-  linklist\n-  blognode\n\n'wrappednode' supports the ``$content`` placeholder variable.\n\nHard-Wired Rendering\n--------------------\n\nBlogNode\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::\n\n    <h2>\n    <a style=\"text-decoration:none;\" href=\"URI\">TITLE</a>\n    </h2>\n    <p style=\"font-size:80%\">CREATOR, DATE</p>\n    <p style=\"font-style:italic;\">ABSTRACT</p>\n    <div>CONTENT</div>\n\nWrap BlogNodes in a ``div`` to control their rendering via CSS.\n\nLinklist\n~~~~~~~~\n\n::\n\n    <div class=\"linklist\">\n    <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"URI\">TITLE</a></li>\n    ...\n    </ul>\n    </div>\n\nGeneral Page Footer\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::\n\n    <p id=\"footer\" style=\"font-size:8pt;text-align:center;\">\n    Powered by <a href=\"http://florian-berger.de/en/software/pycms\">pycms</a>\n    </p>\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nTo read the API documentation, open a shell / DOS window, navigate to\nthe pycms directory, and run\n\n::\n\n    pydoc pycms\n\nYou can create a HTML version using\n\n::\n\n    pydoc -w pycms\n\nLicense\n-------\n\npycms is licensed under the GPL.
