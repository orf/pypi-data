[Overview](#Overview)\n2. [Installation](#Installation)\n    - [Requirements](#Requirements)\n3. [Current Developments](#Current)\n3. [Directories](#Directories)\n        \n## Overview\n\nCarbohydrate Active enZymes are a subset of proteins that generate, modify and/or degrade carbohydrates. CAZy (www.cazy.org) is the most comprehensive CAZyme database, grouping proteins by sequence similarity into CAZy families. **C**azy **F**amily co**V**ariance **investigator** (`cfv_investigator`) investigates the covariance of CAZy family annotations within proteomes across all species annotated by CAZy, and evaluates taxonomic specific covaraince of CAZy families.\n\n`cazomevolve` is a bioinformatic package (still in development) for:\n1. Retrieving of genomic accessions from which proteins catalogued within CAZy are derived from, and the associated taxonomic data of the source organism\n2. Tracking frequency of CAZy family annotations for all genomic assemblies identified in step 1\n3. Calculation of covariance of CAZy family annotations across all genomic assemblies identified in step 1, and for taxonomic specific groups (at the kingdom, genus and species taxonomic level)\n4. Generating dataframes of the number of CAZymes per CAZy family for each genomic assembly\n5. Generating a presence/absence matrix for each CAZy family in each genomic assembly\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Create a virtual environment with dependencies, then activate the environment - _where venv_name is an chosen name for the virtual environment_\n`conda create -n <venv_name> python=3.9`   \n`conda activate <venv_name>`\n\n2. Clone the repository\n`git clone https://github.com/HobnobMancer/cazomevolve.git`\n\n3. Install pyrewton\n`pip3 install -e <path to directory containing setup.py file>`   \nDo not forget to use the **-e** option when install using pip3, otherwise each time pyrewton is invoked a ModuleNotFound error will be raised. Pass the path to the **directory** containign the setup.py file not the path to the setup.py file; if you are currently in the root directory of the repoistory where the file is located, simply use '.' to indicate the current working directory.\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Requirements\n\nPOISx or Mac OS, or linux emulator   \nPython version 3.8+   \nMiniconda3 or Anaconda managed microenvironment, incorporated code checkers are included in list form in 'requirements.txt'.   \nMiniconda3 environment file is also available in the GitHub repository: 'environment.yml'.   \nFor all required Python libraries please read 'requirements.txt'. \n\n* [`ncbi-genome-download`](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download/)\n* [`saintBioutils`](https://github.com/HobnobMancer/saintBioutils)\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n## Method\n\n### Download genomes\n\n#### Already have a list of genomic version accessions\n\nIf you already have a list of genomic version accessions in a plain text file, using the Python package `ncbi-genome-download` to download the genomic assemblies \nin `.gbff` (used to annotate the CAZome) and `.fna` (used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree) formats - do **not** use the `--flat-format` option, leave the genomic assemblies compressed.\n\n#### Retrieve all genomic assemblies associated with a specific term\n\nTo download load all genomic assemblies associated with a term of interest, such as `Pectobacteriaceae` (so as to download all Pectobacteriaceae assemblies), use the Python script `cazomevolve/genomes/download_genomes.py`. The script takes 4 required arguments:\n\n1. User email address (required by NCBI)\n2. The term of interest\n3. The file formats to download the genomic assemblies in. Each file format is defined by its file extension. Separate file formats with a single comma, for example `gbff,fna`\n4. Path to an output directory (this will be build by `cazomevolve`).\n\nBy default if the output directory exists, `cazomevolve` will crash. To write to an existing output directory use the `-f`/`--force` flag. By default, `cazomevolve` will delete all existing data in the existing output directory. To retain the data available in the existing output directory use the `-n`/`--nodelete` flag.\n\n### Extract protein seqs\n\nUse the Python script `cazomevolve/genomes/extract_prot_seqs.py` to extract the protein sequences from annotations in the genomic assemblies.\n\nOne multisequence FASTA file is produced per genomic assembly, listing all protein sequences extracted from the respective genomic assembly.\n\nTwo position arguments are required:\n1. Path to the directory containing the compressed genomic assemblies\n2. Path to an output directory to write out all multisequence FASTA files\n\n## Reconstruct the phylogenetic tree\n\n### A baysian based approach\n\n### A distance based approach\n\n## Annotate the CAZomes\n\n### Option 1: Using `cazomevolve` and `cazy_webscraper`\n\n#### Step 1: Using CAZy -- retrieve the canonical classifications\n\nUse the Python script `cazomevolve/cazome/cazy/get_cazy_cazymes.py`, or the command `cevolve_get_cazy_cazymes` to retrieve the CAZy family classifications for proteins extracted from the genomic assemblies, and write two files of tab delimited list of the:\n1. <fam> <genomic accession>\n2. <fam> <genomic accession> <protein accession>\n\nThe required args are:\n1. Path to the directory containing the FASTA protein sequences files\n2. Path to the local CAZyme database compiled using [`cazy_webscraper`](https://hobnobmancer.github.io/cazy_webscraper/)\n3. Path to an output directory to write out the protein sequences of proteins not listed in the local CAZyme database\n4. Path to write out the tab delimited list of CAZy family annotations and associated genomic assembly accessions\n5. Path to write out the tab delimited list of CAZy family annotations and associated genome and protein accessions \n\n`cazomevolve` will build all necessary output directories.\n\n#### Step 2: Using dbCAN --- retrieve predicted classifications\n\nUse the Python script `cazomevolve/cazome/invoke_dbcan.py` to use `dbCAN` to predicte the CAZymes in each FASTA file of protein sequences.\n\n2 positional arguments are required:\n1. Input dir: path to directory containing all FASTA files of protein sequences\n2. Output dir: path to write out all dbCAN output files. One subdir is created in the output dir for each FASTA file parsed by `dbCAN`\n\nBy default `dbCAN` version >= 3.0.4 is used (which uses `HMMER`, `DIAMOND` and `eCAMI`). To use `dbCAN` version 2.0.11 (which uses `HMMER`, `DIAMOND` and `Hotpep`) add the `-V2` or `--version_2` flag.\n\nTo extract the CAZy family predictions from `dbCAN` version 2 and/or 3, use the Python script `cazomevolve/cazome/get_dbcan_cazymes.py`, which will write out the CAZy family annotations to a tab delimited list. \n\nTwo positional arguments are required:\n1. dbCAN dir: path to output dir from `invoke_dbcan<num>.py`\n2. Path to write out tab delimited list - this may already exist and contain the CAZy family annotations from the local CAZyme database. The script will add the predicted CAZy family annotaitons from the `dbCAN` to the existing file. If a file does not already exist, a new file will be created.\n\n### Option 2: Using `pyrewton` and `cazy_webscraper`\n\nYou can use the Python package [`pyrewton`](https://hobnobmancer.github.io/pyrewton/) to annotate the CAZome for a set of genomic assemblies, using [`cazy_webscraper`](https://hobnobmancer.github.io/cazy_webscraper/) and `dbCAN` [Zhange et al., 2018]. `pyrewton` compiles the canconical and predicted CAZyme classifications into a local SQLite3 database.\n\n> Han Zhang, Tanner Yohe, Le Huang, Sarah Entwistle, Peizhi Wu, Zhenglu Yang, Peter K Busk, Ying Xu, Yanbin Yin, dbCAN2: a meta server for automated carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation, Nucleic Acids Research, Volume 46, Issue W1, 2 July 2018, Pages W95\u2013W101, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky418\n\nTo retrieve the CAZy family annotations associated with each genomic assembly, execute the following sql command against the local CAZome database compiled using `pyrewton`:\n```sql\n\n```\nExport the resulting table as a `tsv` file or tab delimited list.\n\n## Build the input for `coinfinder`\n\n## Find networks of co-evolving CAZy families\n\n## Build a presence/abensce and CAZy family number matrices\n\n## Build dendograms based upon CAZome compositions, and compare against the phylogenetic tree\n\n## Map genome and CAZome distances onto a plot\n\n## Directories\n\nBelow is a directory plan of this repository, followed by a brief overview of each directories role , to facilitate navigation through the repository.\n\n### **assets**\n\nDirectory containing all files needed for the GitHub page, created for easy access to accompanying Jupyter notebooks.\n\n### **docs**\n\nDirectory containing files to build documentation hosted at ReadTheDocs.\n\n### **notebooks**\n\nDirectory containing all Jupyter notebooks, and html copies used for easier in-browser viewing via the GitHub pages. These notebooks include the data outputs from using `cfv_investigator`, how to use the package and how the package works.\n\n### **tests**\n\nDirectory containing all `pytest` files for testing `pyrewton`, including subdirectories for test inputs and targets. Each module/submodule has its own specific test input and target subdirectory.\n\n### **cazomevolve**\n\nDirectory containing all `pyrewton` program modules (including all submodules and Python scripts).\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Modules\n\n_Please find more detailed documentation at for operation and troubleshooting at [Read the Docs](https://phd-project-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)_\n\nThis is an overview of the functionalities of each module within `pyrewton`, as well as basics of operation. For more detailed documentation on the operation of each module and indiviudal Python scripts please see the documentation at [Read the Docs](https://phd-project-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n### **utilities**\n\nContains all functions that are called from other Python scripts for building command-line parsers and loggers. Includes the submodule **file_io**, which contains functions that are called from other Python scripts for handling directories and files in `pyrewton`, including retrieving program inputs and creating output directories.\n\n### **ncbi**\n\nModules that are involved in retrieving handling data from NCBI. This includes retrieval of genomic accession numbers and source organism taxonomic data.\n\n### **covariance**\n\nModules that build the data set required for calculating the covariance, calculate the covariance of CAZy family annotations for all genomic accessions retrieved and taxonomic specific groups.\n",
