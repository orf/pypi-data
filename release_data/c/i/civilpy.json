This program is a simple terminal based software package to give users easier access\nto some of the packages from the python repository.  The package is focused on civil engineering related tasks such as \nfile management, pdf data extraction, image manipulation mapping and unit conversions.  I did my best to make the user \ninterface obvious to use and tried to keep the functionality compatible with tools available to the average Civil \nengineer.\n\n## Intro\n\nThis repository was created in order for me to gain a better understanding of software development work flows and how they can be\nre-purposed for civil engineering related tasks.  This is by no means a comprehensive or even functional repository but \nis more a way for me to track my progress while learning more about another industry.  There may occasionally be how-tos\nand other code posted here but this repository is not meant as tutorial or in depth explanation for how coding works. \nFor those types of things I highly suggest you instead check <a href=https://www.youtube.com/>Youtube</a> for general \nlessons or <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/>Stack Overflow</a> for specific issues.  I highly recommend the \n<a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/cs50tv>Harvard CS50 Youtube Channel</a> for conceptual level programming lessons or\n<a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5>CoreyMS's Youtube Channel</a> for lessons in practical uses of \nprogramming. \n\n## Installation\n\nRun the following code to install the package:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install civilpy\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nto check the package installed correctly, run:\n\n```python\nfrom civilpy.structural.steel import hello_world\n\n# Test the function imported successfully\nhello_world()\n```\n\n# Developing CivilPy\n\nTo install the development environment, instead of just the barebones base package,\nyou can run the following once setting up your virtual environment:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install -e .[dev]\n```\n\n",
