            "description": "# Board Game Factory\n\n### Contributors are welcome here! See the end of readme.\n\nThis is a vector-graphics framework intended for creating\nand scaling up production of reusable assets with vector graphics.\n\nIt is a thick wrapper around cairo for vector graphics and pango for fully\nfeatured text layout and rendering providing very user-friendly for composing\nassets. \n\nI've developed it personally to satisfy my need for a solid prototyping\nengine for board games, but inherently, it is in no way tied to making board games,\neven though it contains a couple convenience classes for that (such as CardSheet for \nproducing printable card sheets out of lists of components).\n\n## Installation\n\nRequires conda and having conda forge in channels (see https://conda-forge.org).\n\nUnfortunately the cairo and pango binary libraries cannot be installed directly \nwith pip. \n\n````\nconda install cairo pango\npip install board-game-factory\n````\n\n## Features\n\n - High quality rendering - BGF is based fully in Vector Graphics, therefore allowing for renders of arbitrary resolution\n - Component Tree structure - similar to making GUIs in Java, you can embed a component inside a component inside a component...\n - Fully extensible components - the best way to use this framework is to\n    create and compose your own components extending base components.\n - Fully dynamic and highly flexible sizing system:\n   - Component width/height possible values:\n     - INFER - the component decides on its own how large it should be\n     - FILL - fill all available remaining space in the parent Container\n     - '12.34%' - take up 12.34% of available space\n     - 123 - take up 123 pixels\n - Many basic and advanced components are already implemented:\n   - Container - base component with a layout manager, you add components into it. \n   - Shapes\n     - Rectangle\n     - RoundedRectangle\n     - Circle\n     - Line\n   - TextUniform - a fully featured text rendering component (exposing most advanced features of pango) \n     for rendering text of a uniform style (all characters have same font, size, color, ...).\n   - TextMarkup - advanced text component supporting markup for strings with multiple styles (boldface words, multiple colors, ...)\n     - features smart inline laying of icons (any images) for embedding icons directly in text\n   - Grid - a special component for creating table structures:\n     - each cell can have unique parameters (e.g. layout manager)\n     - incredibly flexible row and column definitions (INFER, FILL, %, px)\n     - fully featured cell merging\n   - just with those few components + LayoutManagers I've made all the samples you can see below in the link on imgur.\n - LayoutManagers\n   - Absolute - define pixels\n   - HorizontalFlow, VerticalFlow - align automatically to row or column\n   - Fully extensible, you can write your own\n\n## Usage\n\nFor examples of usage see tests.\n\n## Things I made with BGF\n\nSamples of prototypes I've made with this framework:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/TS779gR\n\n## Issues\n\nPlease report any issues and feel free to try and fix them on your own.\n\n\n## Contributors Wanted!\n\nI would love to welcome people on board who would like to extend the project\nor improve it, if you're interested you can drop in a PR directly or we can first discuss,\nyou can reach me at adam.volny at gmail dot com.\n\nFor a hobby project, I think it has a surprisingly high quality of design and code. \nThere are is quite a good test coverage, all tests are performed directly against\nrendered references. This allowed for controlled development of many of the complex features\nin this framework (dynamic sizing & positioning is really difficult with this\namount of supported features).\n\nIt could be extended to do many things (e.g. a gui board game asset builder, \ncoupled with inputs from spreadsheets, ...), I would love to hear Your ideas!\n\n",
