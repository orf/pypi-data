Go to *Timesheets > Timesheet > All Timesheets*.\n#. Create a new record.\n#. You will see now that the *Date* field contains also time information.\n#. If you don't select any \"project\", you will be able to select any \"task\",\n   opened or not.\n#. Selecting a \"task\", the corresponding \"project\" is filled.\n#. Selecting a \"project\", tasks are filtered for only allow\n   to select opened tasks for that project. Remember that an opened task is\n   a task whose stage doesn't have \"Closed\" mark checked.\n#. At the end of the line, you will see a stop button.\n#. When you press this button, the difference between *Date* field and the\n   current time is saved in the \"Duration\" field.\n#. You can modify the *Date* field for altering the computation of the\n   duration.\n#. After a record is stopped, you see a *Resume* button, which will open a\n   wizard that inherits all relevant values from that timesheet line and lets\n   you duplicate it to indicate you start working in the same thing.\n#. If you didn't stop the timer, but still hit *Resume* in any other, the\n   wizard will tell you that you have a running timer and that starting a new\n   one will stop the other one that is running.\n\nTo access the wizard directly:\n\n#. Go to *Timesheet > Timesheet > Start work*.\n#. You will be able to enter a new timesheet line from scratch, but by using\n   this wizard, you avoid problems with old or duplicate running timers.\n\nOr via projects:\n\n#. Go to *Project > Projects*.\n#. If a project has a running timesheet line, it will display a *Stop* button.\n#. Other projects that have enabled timesheets will display a *Start* button\n   that will open the same wizard as the timesheet lines, but duplicating\n   project's last timesheet line without a task.\n#. You can see the same in list and form views.\n\nOr via tasks:\n\n#. Go to *Project > All Tasks*.\n#. If a task has a running timesheet line, it will display a *Stop* button.\n#. Other tasks that have enabled timesheets will display a *Start* button\n   that will open the same wizard as the timesheet lines, duplicating task's\n   last timesheet line.\n#. You can see the same in list view.\n#. Click on any existing task or create a new one.\n#. You can see the same feature in the action buttons box.\n#. On the *Timesheets* page, you will be able to handle records the same way\n   as you do in the above explanation (except the task selection part, which\n   in this case doesn't appear as it's the current one).\n\nNote: All the *Start/Resume/Stop* features are disabled if you don't belong to\nthe *Timesheets/User* group or if you are viewing a timesheet that belongs\nto another user.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Rename to ``hr_timesheet_time_control``.\n* Move to `OCA/timesheet <https://github.com/OCA/timesheet>`__.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/project/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/project/issues/new?body=module:%20project_timesheet_time_control%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n    * Pedro M.
