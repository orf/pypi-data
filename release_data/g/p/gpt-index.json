            "description": "# \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f \ufe0fGPT Index\n\nGPT Index is a project consisting of a set of *data structures* that are created using GPT-3 and can be traversed using GPT-3 in order to answer queries.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Overview\n\n#### Context\n- GPT-3 is a phenomenonal piece of technology for knowledge generation and reasoning.\n- A big limitation of GPT-3 is context size (e.g. Davinci's limit is 4096 tokens. Large, but not infinite).\n- The ability to feed \"knowledge\" to GPT-3 is restricted to this limited prompt size and model weights.\n- **Thought**: What if GPT-3 can have access to potentially a much larger database of knowledge without retraining/finetuning? \n\n#### Proposed Solution\nThat's where the **GPT Index** data structures come in. Instead of relying on world knowledge encoded in the model weights, a GPT Index data structure does the following:\n- Uses a pre-trained GPT-3 model primarily for *reasoning*/*summarization* instead of prior knowledge.\n- Takes as input a large corpus of text data and build a structured index over it (using GPT-3 or heuristics).\n- Allow users to _query_ the index in order to synthesize an answer to the question - this requires both _traversal_ of the index as well as a synthesis of the answer.\n\nThe high-level design exercise of this project is to test the capability of GPT-3 as a general-purpose processor to organize and retrieve data. From our current understanding, related works have used GPT-3 to reason with external db sources (see below); this work links reasoning with knowledge building.\n\n## \ud83d\udcbb Example Usage\n\n```\npip install gpt-index\n```\n\nExamples are in the `examples` folder. Indices are in the `indices` folder (see list of indices below).\n\nTo build a tree index do the following:\n```python\nfrom gpt_index import GPTTreeIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader('data').load_data()\nindex = GPTTreeIndex(documents)\n```\n\nTo save to disk and load from disk, do\n```python\n# save to disk\nindex.save_to_disk('index.json')\n# load from disk\nindex = GPTTreeIndex.load_from_disk('index.json')\n```\n\nTo query,\n```python\nindex.query(\"<question_text>?\", child_branch_factor=1)\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 Dependencies\n\nThe main third-party package requirements are `transformers`, `openai`, and `langchain`.\n\nAll requirements should be contained within the `setup.py` file. To run the package locally without building the wheel, simply do `pip install -r requirements.txt`. \n\n\n\n## Index Details\n\n- [`Tree Index`](gpt_index/indices/tree/README.md): Tree data structures\n    - **Creation**: with GPT hierarchical summarization over sub-documents\n    - **Query**: with GPT recursive querying over multiple choice problems\n- [`Keyword Table Index`](gpt_index/indices/keyword_table/README.md): a keyword-based table\n    - **Creation**: with GPT keyword extraction over each sub-document\n    - **Query**: with GPT keyword extraction over question, match to sub-documents. *Create and refine* an answer over candidate sub-documents.\n- [`List Index`](gpt_index/indices/list/README.md): a simple list-based data structure\n    - **Creation**: by splitting documents into a list of text chunks\n    - **Query**: use GPT with a create and refine prompt iterately over the list of sub-documents\n\n\n## Does this actually work?\n\nIt works in varying degrees depending on the index struct (tree, keyword), the data,\nand the question asked.\n\nCheck out this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1590192529286520832?s=20&t=1Ss6eJJMZzFA6y-QmSU9lw) for instance describing the tree index.\n\n\n## \u2753\ud83e\udde0 Additional Thoughts / FAQ\n\n**How is this better than an embeddings-based approach / other state-of-the-art QA and retrieval methods?**\n\nThe intent is not to compete against existing methods. An embedding-based technique could be to just encode each chunk as an embedding and do a simple question-document embedding look-up to retrieve the result. \n\nInstead, this project is focused on providing a set of data structures to test how GPT can organize information and lookup information purely through the text-in/text-out paradigm.\n\n**This work is very similar to X paper/project.**\n\nPlease let me know! I am not up-to-date on the latest NLP/LLM ArXiv papers or Github projects. I am happy to give references/credit below.\n\n\n## \ud83d\udd2c Related Work [WIP]\n\n[Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models, by Press et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03350)\n- Introduces a *self-ask* paradigm, which forces the model to ask and answer followup questions before answering the original question. Similar to GPT Index in that it uses GPT to reason through subproblems; the difference is that the GPT Index also tries to organize the external information as opposed to being trained on it.\n- [Example (from Langchain)](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/examples/self_ask_with_search.ipynb)\n\n\n[ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models, by Yao et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)\n- Introduces a joint reasoning and action framework in an interleaved manner. This approach of connecting to external knowledge sources is similar to our approach of having GPT traverse an externally stored index of data. ReAct has much more fluid/sophisticated ways of traversal (e.g. search, lookup, finish), whereas this project just tries building an index with simple tree-based traversal.",
