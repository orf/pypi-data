If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 4.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

You can build the docs locally by read the docs/readme.md.\n```\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\npip install dlk\n\nor \ngit clong this repo and do\n\npython setup.py install\n\n```\n## What is this project do?\n\n* Provide a templete for deep learning (especially for nlp) training and deploy.\n* Provide parameters search.\n* Provide basic architecture search.\n* Provide some basic modules and models.\n* Provide basic deploy method.\n\n## More Feature is Comming\n\n- [ ] Add more documents.\n- [ ] Distill structure.\n- [ ] Adv training.\n- [ ] Add disable tokenizer post process.\n\n- [ ] Predict\n\n    - [X] Complete the main predict code.\n    - [ ] Test.\n    - [ ] Convert to TorchScript.\n    - [ ] Convert to ONNXRT\n\n* [X] When the high config change the _name of the basic config, the base config should be coverd.\n\n- [ ] One `optimizer` different para groups use different `scheduler`s.\n  \n    - [ ] Ref [diff_schedule](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CyclicLR.html#torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CyclicLR)\n    - [ ] Add loss schedule, get best checkpoint by loss.\n\n- [ ] Support LightGBM, it's maybe not necessary? Will split to another package.\n* [ ] Make CRF and more modules which uses the op like `for` and `if` to be scriptable\uff08`for`\uff0c`if`\uff09\n* [ ] Validating LSTM module is scriptable or not?\n* [ ] Add UnitTest\n\n\n",
