            "description": "# Paraphase: HiFi-based SMN1/SMN2 variant caller\n\nSMN1, the gene that causes spinal muscular atrophy, is considered a 'dark' region of the genome due to high sequence similarity with its paralog SMN2. Paraphase is a Python tool that takes HiFi BAMs as input (whole-genome or enrichment), assembles complete SMN1 and SMN2 haplotypes, determines copy numbers and makes phased variant calls for both genes. It also categorizes the haplotypes, enabling future haplotype-based screening of silent carriers (2+0). Please check out our preprint for more details about the method and our population-wide haplotype analysis.   \n\nFor whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, we recommend >20X, ideally 30X, genome coverage. Low coverage or short read length could result in less accurate phasing, especially when haplotypes are highly similar to each other in Exons 1-6. For hybrid capture-based enrichment data, a higher read depth (>50X) is recommended as the read length is generally shorter than WGS.\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you need assistance or have suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out by email or open a GitHub issue.\n\nXiao Chen: xchen@pacificbiosciences.com\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)\n- [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)\n- [singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) (if you would like to run [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) and generate vcfs on assembled haplotypes)\n\n## Installation\n\nParaphase can be installed through pip:\n```bash\npip install paraphase\n```\n\nAlternatively, Paraphase can be installed from GitHub.\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/paraphase\ncd paraphase\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n## Running the program\n\n```bash\nparaphase -b input.bam -o output_directory\n```\n\nAlternatively when you have a list of bam files\n```bash\nparaphase -l list.txt -o output_directory\n```\n\nRequired parameters:\n- `-b`: Input BAM file or `-l`: List of BAM files (one per line)\n- `-o`: Output directory\n\nOptional parameters:\n- `-v`: If specified, Paraphase will run DeepVariant to produce VCFs for each haplotype (singularity is required).\n- `-c`: Config file, default config file is `paraphase/data/smn1/config.yaml`.\n- `-t`: Number of threads, used when `-l` is specified.\n- `-d`: File listing average genome depth per sample, with two columns, sample ID and depth values, separated by tab or space. This saves run time by skipping the step to calculate genome depth.\n- `--samtools`\n- `--minimap2`\n- `--singularity`\n\nThe paths to samtools, minimaps and singularity (only required if `-v` is specified) can be provided through the `--samtools`, `--minimap2` and `--singularity` parameters or by modifying the `tools` section of the [config](paraphase/data/smn1/config.yaml) file.\n\nNote that currently only GRCh38 is supported. We will support GRCh37 in the future if there is request.\n\n## Interpreting the output\n\nParaphase produces a few output files in the directory specified by `-o`, with the sample ID as the prefix.\n- `_realigned_tagged.bam`: This BAM file can be loaded into IGV for visualization of haplotypes, see the next [section](#visualizing-the-output).  \n- If `-v` is specified, Paraphase will generate VCF files produced by DeepVariant. A VCF file is written for each haplotype, and there is also a `_variants.vcf` file containing merged variants from all haplotypes. This is a nonstandard scenario with variable ploidy, and we will continue to improve the variant filtering and merging steps. Any suggestions are welcome.\n- `.json`: Main output file, summerizes haplotypes and variant calls for each sample. Details of the fields are explained below:\n  - `smn1_cn`: copy number of SMN1, a `null` call indicates that Paraphase finds only one haplotype but depth does not unambiguously support a copy number of one or two.\n  - `smn2_cn`: copy number of SMN2, a `null` call indicates that Paraphase finds only one haplotype but depth does not unambiguously support a copy number of one or two.\n  - `smn2_del78_cn`: copy number of SMN2\u03947\u20138 (SMN2 with a deletion of Exon7-8)\n  - `smn1_read_number`: number of reads containing c.840C\n  - `smn2_read_number`: number of reads containing c.840T\n  - `smn2_del78_read_number`: number of reads containing the known deletion of Exon7-8 on SMN2\n  - `smn1_haplotypes`: SMN1 haplotypes assembled\n  - `smn2_haplotypes`: SMN2 haplotypes assembled\n  - `smn2_del78_haplotypes`: SMN2\u03947\u20138 haplotypes assembled\n  - `two_copy_haplotypes`: haplotypes that are present in two copies based on depth. This happens when (in a small number of cases) two haplotypes are identical and we infer that there exist two of them instead of one by checking the read depth.\n  - `haplotype_details`: lists information about each haplotype \n    - `variants`: The variants contained in the haplotype. The variants listed here could be a subset of those called by DeepVariant, as we use a simple pileup method to call variants and we exclude homopolymer regions. For most accurate variant calls, please use the `-v` option.\n    - `boundary`: The boundary of the region that is resolved on the haplotype. This is useful when a haplotype is only partially assembled.\n    - `haplogroup`: The haplogroup that the haplotype is assigned to\n\n## Visualizing the output\nWe can visualize the haplotypes by loading the output file `_realigned_tagged.bam` into IGV and grouping reads by the `HP` tag.\n\n![example1](docs/figures/example_HG02300.png)\n\nIn this example, there are three copies of SMN1 and one copy of SMN2. All reads are aligned to SMN1. Reads in blue are uniquely assigned to a haplotype. Reads in gray are consistent with more than one possible haplotype (this happens when those haplotypes are identical over a region - here `smn1hap1`, `smn1hap3` and `smn2hap1` are identical from the region upstream of SMN1 all the way to halfway into Intron 1). When there are several possible haplotypes consisent with a read, the read is randomly assigned to a haplotype and colored in gray. The `Unassigned` category contains reads that carry bases that do not agree with any haplotypes (this could be due to sequencing errors or short haplotypes).\n\n![example2](docs/figures/example_HG00673.png)\n\nIn this second example, Paraphase assembles one SMN1 haplotype and two SMN2 haplotypes. The depth of `smn1hap1` suggests that it is present in two copies, so Paraphase infers that there are two copies of SMN1 (their haplotype sequences are identical).\n\nThe `examples` folders contains IGV sessions showing a few more examples.\n\n",
