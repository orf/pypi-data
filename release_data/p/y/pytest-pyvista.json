It\ngenerates a cache of images from the tests, using the `PyVista` plotting\nfunction in its first execution. Then, further executions will compare its\nresults against this cache, so if there are any changes in the code that break\nthe image generation, the comparison against the cache will notice it. Note\nthat there is an error tolerance in the comparison, so minor differences won't\nfail.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\nYou must have a Python version greater than 3.7, as well as PyVista installed\nin your environment.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install \"pytest-pyvista\" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::\n\n    $ pip install pytest-pyvista\n\n\nUsage\n-----\nOnce installed, you only need to use the command `pl.show()` in your test. The\nplugin will automatically manage the cache generation if it does not exist, and\nthe image comparison itself. Make sure you enable `pv.OFF_SCREEN` when loading\nPyVista, so the `pl.show()` doesn't pop up any window while testing::\n\n    import pyvista as pv\n    pv.OFF_SCREEN = True\n    def test_succeeds():\n        pl = pyvista.Plotter()\n        pl.add_mesh(pyvista.Sphere(), show_edges=True)\n        pl.show()\n\n\nIf you need to use any flag inside the tests, you need to use the\n`verify_image_cache` fixture as a parameter to the test::\n\n\n    import pyvista as pv\n    pv.OFF_SCREEN = True\n    def test_succeeds(verify_image_cache):\n        verify_image_cache.windows_skip_image_cache = True\n        pl = pyvista.Plotter()\n        pl.add_mesh(pyvista.Sphere(), show_edges=True)\n        pl.show()\n\n\n\nGlobal flags\n------------\nThese are the flags you can use when calling ``pytest`` in the command line:\n\n* ``--reset_image_cache`` creates a new image for each test in\n  ``tests/plotting/test_plotting.py`` and is not recommended except for\n  testing or for potentially a major or minor release. \n\n* You can use ``--ignore_image_cache`` if you are running on Linux and want to\n  temporarily ignore regression testing. Realize that regression testing will\n  still occur on our CI testing.\n\n* When using ``--fail_extra_image_cache`` if there is an extra image in the\n  cache, it will report as an error.\n\nTest specific flags\n-------------------\nThese are attributes of `verify_image_cache`. You can set them as `True` if needed in the beginning of your test function.\n\n* high_variance_tests: If necessary, the threshold for determining if a test\n  will pass or not is incremented to another predetermined threshold. This is\n  currently done due to the use of an unstable version of VTK, in stable\n  versions this shouldn't be necessary.\n\n* windows_skip_image_cache: For test where the plotting in Windows is different\n  from MacOS/Linux.\n\n* macos_skip_image_cache: For test where the plotting in MacOS is different\n  from Windows/Linux.\n\n* skip: If you have a test that plots a figure, but you don't want to compare\n  its output against the cache, you can skip it with this flag.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\nContributions are always welcome. Tests can be run with `tox`_, please ensure\nthe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nDistributed under the terms of the `MIT`_ license, ``pytest-pyvista`` is free\nand open source software.\n\n\nIssues\n------\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please `file an issue`_ along with a detailed\ndescription.\n\n.. _`Cookiecutter`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _`@hackebrot`: https://github.com/hackebrot\n.. _`MIT`: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n.. _`BSD-3`: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\n.. _`GNU GPL v3.0`: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt\n.. _`Apache Software License 2.0`: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n.. _`cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin\n.. _`file an issue`: https://github.com/pyvista/pytest-pyvista/issues\n.. _`pytest`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest\n.. _`tox`: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _`pip`: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n.. _`PyPI`: https://pypi.org/project\n",
