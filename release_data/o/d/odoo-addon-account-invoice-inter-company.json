If you need both, uninstall `remove_odoo_entreprise`, complete settings with `account_invoice_inter_company` and then re-install `remove_odoo_entreprise`.\n * Product mapping: would be nice to have a matrix with the products on the left side and on the top row the companies.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/multi-company/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/multi-company/issues/new?body=module:%20account_invoice_inter_company%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Odoo SA\n* Akretion\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Odoo S.A.
