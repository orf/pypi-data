Windows, Linux, macOS, openBSD; x86, amd64, ARM and so on...**\n\n## Install\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)\n- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n- [Pip](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/)\n\nSome platforms may need other software for some entities.\n\n#### Install all requirements on ArchLinux\n\n```shell\npacman -Syu base-devel git python python-pip\n```\n\n#### Install and update all requirements on Debain\n\n```shell\napt install git python3 python3-pip libdbus-glib-1-dev\npip install --upgrade pip\n```\n\n#### Install and update all requirements on Ubuntu\n\n```\napt install git python3 python3-pip libdbus-glib-1-dev meson patchelf\npip install --upgrade pip\n```\n\n#### Windows\n\n- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), pip included\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win), just accept the defaults\n\n### Download and install with pip\n\nOn Linux:\n\n```shell\npip install \"IoTuring[linux] @ git+https://github.com/richibrics/IoTuring\"\n```\n\nOn Windows:\n\n```shell\npy -m pip install \"IoTuring[win] @ git+https://github.com/richibrics/IoTuring\"\n```\n\nNote: on Windows you have to prefix every command with `py -m` as here.\n\nOn MacOs:\n\n```shell\npip install \"IoTuring[macos] @ git+https://github.com/richibrics/IoTuring\"\n```\n\n### Configure\n\nThe first time you run IoTuring you need to specify which entities and warehouses you want to enable.\nTo run in configuration mode, you only need to specify the '-c' argument along the script execution command:\n\n```\nIoTuring -c\n```\n\nA simple menu will show and you will be able to configure your entities and warehouses !\nOnce you have selected your preferred settings, you're ready to run IoTuring.\n\nYou will be able to enter the configuration menu whenever you want (with the same command as above) to edit your choises.\n\n### Run \n\nYou can simply run IoTuring using this command\n\n```\nIoTuring\n```\n\n### HomeAssistant demo\n\nYour computer will show up in HomeAssistant as a single Device, so all your entities will be grouped together. \nThe device will also have some properties like connectivity and battery status.\n\nYou can see how your device will appear under the Devices section in Home Assistant in the following GIF (wait until it's loaded):\n\n\n![device](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12238652/187725698-dafceb9c-c746-4a84-9b2c-caf5ea46a802.gif)\n\nAll sensors and switches will be available to be added to your dashboard in your favourite cards !\n\n### Available entities\n\n- ActiveWindow: shares the name of the window you're working on\n- AppInfo: shares app informations like the running version\n- Battery: shares the battery level and charging status\n- BootTime: shares the machine boot time\n- Cpu: shares useful information about cpu usage (times, frequencies, percentages) \n- DesktopEnvironment: shares the running desktop environment (useful only for Linux)\n- Disk: shares disk usage data\n- Hostname: shares the machine hostname\n- Lock: permits a remote lock command to lock the machine\n- Monitor: permits remote monitors control commands\n- Notify: permits remote notify show on your machine\n- Os: shares the operating system of your machine\n- Power*: permits remote poweroff, reboot and sleep commands\n- Ram: shares useful information about ram usage\n- Time: shares the machine local time\n- Uptime: shares the time since the machine is on\n- Username: shares the name of the user who is working on the machine\n\n\\* To use the features from Power entity on Linux and macOS you need to give permissions to your user to shutdown and reboot without sudo password.\nYou can easily do that by adding the following line at the end of the \"/etc/sudoers\" file (you can use the following command: sudo nano /etc/sudoers):\n\n```\nYOURUSERNAMEHERE ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff, /sbin/reboot, /sbin/shutdown\n```\n\nChange **YOURUSERNAMEHERE** with the user that runs the script.\n\n### Available warehouses\n\n- HomeAssistant: shares sensors and switches to HomeAssistant. The machine is shown as a Device and all the entites are grouped together. **recommended**\n- MQTT: sends data to MQTT broker and subscribes to commands topics.\n- Console: prints data to the console\n\n\n## Development\n\n### Editable install\n\n[Pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/)\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/richibrics/IoTuring\ncd IoTuring\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### Versioning\n\nThe project uses [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/):\n\n`YYYY.0M.n`:\n\n- `YYYY`: Full year: 2022, 2023 ...\n- `0M`: Zero-padded month: 01, 02 ... 11, 12\n- `n`: Build number in the month: 1, 2 ...\n",
