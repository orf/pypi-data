It is close in spirit to [pandas][] or [SFrame][]; however we\nput specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As the name suggests, the\npackage is closely related to R's [data.table][] and attempts to mimic its core\nalgorithms and API.\n\nRequirements: Python 3.6+ (64 bit) and pip 20.3+.\n\n\n## Project goals\n\n`datatable` started in 2017 as a toolkit for performing big data (up to 100GB)\noperations on a single-node machine, at the maximum speed possible. Such\nrequirements are dictated by modern machine-learning applications, which need\nto process large volumes of data and generate many features in order to\nachieve the best model accuracy. The first user of `datatable` was\n[Driverless.ai][].\n\nThe set of features that we want to implement with `datatable` is at least\nthe following:\n\n* Column-oriented data storage.\n\n* Native-C implementation for all datatypes, including strings. Packages such\n  as pandas and numpy already do that for numeric columns, but not for\n  strings.\n\n* Support for date-time and categorical types. Object type is also supported,\n  but promotion into object discouraged.\n\n* All types should support null values, with as little overhead as possible.\n\n* Data should be stored on disk in the same format as in memory. This will\n  allow us to memory-map data on disk and work on out-of-memory datasets\n  transparently.\n\n* Work with memory-mapped datasets to avoid loading into memory more data than\n  necessary for each particular operation.\n\n* Fast data reading from CSV and other formats.\n\n* Multi-threaded data processing: time-consuming operations should attempt to\n  utilize all cores for maximum efficiency.\n\n* Efficient algorithms for sorting/grouping/joining.\n\n* Expressive query syntax (similar to [data.table][]).\n\n* Minimal amount of data copying, copy-on-write semantics for shared data.\n\n* Use \"rowindex\" views in filtering/sorting/grouping/joining operators to\n  avoid unnecessary data copying.\n\n* Interoperability with pandas / numpy / pyarrow / pure python: the users\n  should have the ability to convert to another data-processing framework\n  with ease.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nOn macOS, Linux and Windows systems installing datatable is as easy as\n```sh\npip install datatable\n```\n\nOn all other platforms a source distribution will be needed. For more\ninformation see [Build instructions](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\n\n\n## See also\n\n* [Build instructions](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)\n* [Documentation](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n\n  [pandas]: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n  [sframe]: https://github.com/turi-code/SFrame\n  [data.table]: https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table\n  [driverless.ai]: https://www.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/\n",
