Target Connectors (Connectors that export data)\n3. Integration Connectors (Generic integrations for other services)\n\nWhen developing these connectors, developers must adhere to a few guidelines mentioned below.\n\n## Naming the Connector\n\n- Package name of the connector must be in the `c8-{type}-{connector}` format (i.e `c8-source-postgres`).\n- Module name of the connector must be in the `c8_{type}_{connector}` format (i.e `c8_source_postgres`).\n\n## Project structure (package names and structure)\n\n- Project source code must follow the below structure.\n```text\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 c8_{type}_{connector}\n\u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502        \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py\n\u2502        \u2514\u2500\u2500 {other source files or modules}\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pyproject.toml\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 setup.cfg\n```\n- Within the `/c8_{type}_{connector}/__init__.py` there must be a class which implements `C8Connector` interface.\n\n## Dependencies/Libraries and their versions to use.\n\n- Connectors must only use following dependencies/libraries and mentioned versions' when developing.\n```text\npython = \">=3.7\"\nc8connector = \"latest\"\npipelinewise-singer-python = \"1.2.0\"\n```\n- Developers must not use `singer-sdk` or any other singer sdk variants other than `pipelinewise-singer-python`.\n\n## Samples\n- Postgres Source Connector: [Git Repository](https://github.com/Macrometacorp/c8-source-postgres)\n- Oracle Source Connector: [Git Repository](https://github.com/Macrometacorp/c8-source-oracle)\n- C8 Collections target Connector: [Git Repository](https://github.com/Macrometacorp/c8-target-c8collection)\n",
