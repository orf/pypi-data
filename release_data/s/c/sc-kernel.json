Instead create a new cell with a single dot\n\n```\n.\n```\n\nand execute this cell. This will transform the command to `CommandPeriod.run;` which is what is actually called on the `Cmd + .` press in the IDE.\n\n\n ### Recording\n\n`sc_kernel` provides an easy way to record audio to the local directory and store it in the notebook\nso one can later share the notebook with the sound examples embedded.\n\nAssuming one has started the server, simply execute\n\n```supercollider\n%% record \"my_file.flac\"\n\n{SinOsc.ar(SinOsc.ar(200)*200)*0.2!2}.play;\n```\n\nto start the recording.\n\nTo stop the recording, simply stop the Server recording via\n\n```supercollider\ns.stopRecording;\n```\n\nIf one has chosen FLAC or WAV as file format, one will see a playback menu for the file within the notebook.\n\n![Recording magic](recording.png)\n\nIf an relative path is provided as filename it will be put relative to the folder where `jupyter lab` was executed.\nIf an absolute path is given the output will be directed to the absolute path.\n\nKeep in mind that **good browser support only exists for FLAC** and with WAV the seeking does not work.\nThe standard recording format of supercollider AIFF is not supported by browsers.\n\n### Autocomplete\n\nSimply push `Tab` to see available autocompletions.\n\n### Documentation\n\nTo display the documentation of a Class, simply prepend a `?` to it and execute it, e.g.\n\n```supercollider\n?SinOsc\n```\n\n## Development\n\nAny PR is welcome! Please state the changes in an Issue.\nTo contribute, please\n\n* Fork the repository and clone it to a local directory\n\n* If one wants to add the kernel to an existing Jupyter installation one can execute\n\n  ```shell\n  jupyter kernelspec install sc_kernel\n  ```\n\n  and run `jupyter lab` from within the cloned directory as\n  we need to have access to `sc_kernel`.\n\n* Run `./run_tests.sh` and make a PR :)\n  The tests often run into a pexpect timeout for some reason.\n  They should pass if they are run alone.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n* [Dennis Scheiba](https://dennis-scheiba.com)\n\n\n",
