            "description": "# FONSIM\n#### _Fluidic Object-oriented Network SIMulator_\n\nAn object-oriented Python 3 library designed for simulating pneumatic and hydraulic systems in soft robots.\n\nThis project is available under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (**agpl-3.0**) license.\n\n### Installation\nThe pre-packaged release version can be installed using `pip install fonsim`.\nSee the [PyPi page](https://pypi.org/project/fonsim/) for more information.\n\nCurrently, FONSIM resides in an early alpha stage.\nNot all features work yet and you will encounter bugs.\nWe look forward to your feedback.\nThank you for your understanding.\n\n\n### Features\n* Powerful and fast simulation backend\n  - Newton-Raphson method for handling nonlinear equations\n  - Backward Euler time discretization for stability\n* Implicit component equations\n* Fluid class\n  - custom fluids, e.g. non-Newtonian\n  - fallback functionality\n* Toolset focused on soft robotics (SoRo) research\n  - read and process pv-curves\n* Standard library of fluidic components\n  - Tubes, nodes, pressure sources, volume sources, containers, one-way valves, ...\n* Flow calculations\n  - Compressible flow approximations\n  - Laminar and turbulent flow based on Reynold number\n  - Major and minor losses (Darcy, Haaland, K-factor etc.)\n*  Preconfigured custom plot methods\n* Export data for further processing as JSON file\n* Cross platform\n\n\n\n### How to get started\nThe [examples directory](https://gitlab.com/abaeyens/fonsim/-/tree/master/examples) contains a set of examples showcasing various features of the simulator.\nWe suggest to start with running the examples.\nFurthermore you may want to consult the documentation on\n[readthedocs.org]().\n__Note__: documentation is a WIP, not yet available.\nThe same documentation is also available by the\n[Python help function](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/docstrings#help).\nIf something is not fully clear, please let us know.\n\n### Dependencies\n* matplotlib\n* numpy\n* scipy\n\n\n\n## Project development, contribution\n\n### Contributing\nAre you interested in contributing to this project?\nPlease get in touch so we can coordinate the development!\n\n### Branching\nThe FONS project branching is based on the\n[Driessen or git-flow model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).\nPut simply,\nthe `master` branch is reserved for production-ready code.\nAll software in `master` should be stable and usable.\nThe `dev` branch contains the latest developed features,\nyet as a result the software is not as stable.\nThe actual features (and improvements in general) are developed in the\nfeature branches, for example `feature-plotting`.\n\n### To get this repo locally\n1. Clone the repo (notice the `$` - this means to do it in a terminal/console).\nThe directory with the project will be located in the current working directory of the terminal.\n    ```\n    $ git clone git@gitlab.com:abaeyens/fonsim.git\n    ```\n1. Go in the created directory (note: one can use `TAB` for autocompletion)\n    ```\n    $ cd fonsim\n    ```\n\n### Create a local install\nA local install allows to try out the library locally.\nThis can be useful during development.\nFirst, rename the project root directory to `fonsim` (default name after Git clone: `fons`).\nSecond, run in the project root directory:\n```\n$ python -m pip install -e .\n```\nThis installs the FONS package such that it is accessible\nlike all other Python packages, e.g. using `import fonsim`.\nThe `-e` option denotes that it uses a symbolic link:\ncode changes in the project directory (including branch switching)\ntake effect at the first following `import`.\nNo re-installation is required.\n\nNote: `python` should refer to Python 3.\nYou may have to write `python3` to avoid using Python 2. \n\nNote: there appear to be problems with this method on some Windows machines.\n\nNote: if you want to install several versions of the same package on your system,\nfor example a stable version from PyPi\nand a development version from a local install,\nyou may want to use a\n[Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).\n\n### Development tools\nA git repository history visualizer tool like\n[gitg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg/)\ncan be helpful in developing this software.\nIt shows the relations between version branches visually,\nlists all commits and allows to see the exact changes\nwere made in a particular commit.\nIn addition, it can show uncommitted changes.\n\nGitlab provides similar tools as a web version like the\n[GitLab graph](https://gitlab.com/abaeyens/fonsim/-/network/master).\n\n### Style guide\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html.\n\n### Contributors\nArne Baeyens  \nBert Van Raemdonck  \n\n\n## Problems, questions, suggestions\nIf you have a question the FAQ section does not answer sufficiently,\nor you think you have encountered a bug,\nyou can reach out by creating an issue on the\n[GitLab Issues](https://gitlab.com/abaeyens/fonsim/-/issues) page.\nThe issues page is also the proper place to post suggestions and feedback.\n\n\n## FAQ\n...\n\n\n",
