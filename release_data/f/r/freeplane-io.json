            "description": "# freeplane-python-io\n\nThis package provides the user a convenient way to create, read, update and\ndelete information stored inside Freeplan mindmap files. As an alternative or\nan enhancement to working with mindmaps through the original graphical user\ninterface (GUI) which is provided by the brilliant Freeplane Mindmap Editor,\nthis package was designed to implement an application programming interface\n(API) for Python as well as a command line interface (CLI) both to interact\nwith Freeplane mindmap files, directly.\n\n## installation\n\n```bash\npip install freeplane-io\n```\n\n## usage\n\n```python\nimport freeplane\n\n\n\n\n#\n# load existing mindmap\n#\n\n# in order to access a mindmap, you first have to open it using\n# the following function. please provide a valid path to your\n# already existing Freeplane mindmap within the argument of the\n# following function.\n\n# load\nmindmap = freeplane.Mindmap('./example_IN.mm')\n\n# show available node styles\nmindmap.styles\n\n\n\n\n#\n# check for GTD tasks\n#\n\n# there is a Freeplane addon \"GTD+\" which uses exclamation mark\n# icons as identifiers for a GTD element within a Freeplane\n# mindmap. In order to get a list of all these GTD elements,\n# you can use the following method.\n\ntasks = mindmap.find_nodes(icon=freeplane.ICON_EXCLAMATION)\n\n\n\n\n#\n# search for any core text\n#\n\n# in order to search the whole mindmap for a specific text string\n# expected within the core section of a node, the following\n# method can be used.\n\n# search whole mindmap for \"test\"\nnodes = mindmap.find_nodes(core=\"test\", exact=True)\n\n# search whole mindmap for \"test\", \"tEST\", ...\nif not nodes:\n    nodes = mindmap.find_nodes(core=\"test\")\n\n# get first node from list\nnode = nodes[0]\n\n# printout its plain text\nprint(node.plaintext)\n\n\n\n\n#\n# write into existing mindmap\n#\n\n# modify test node's core text and color\nnode.plaintext = 'found and changed'\n\n# create a test style\nmindmap.add_style(\"test\", {\"bgcolor\": \"#999999\"})\n\n# set test style in node\nnode.style = \"test\"\n\n\n\n\n#\n# save mindmap\n#\n\nmindmap.save('./example_OUT.mm')\n```\n\n## the code base\n\n### naming conventions for classes, functions, ... and variables\n\nUsing Python, developers are always encouraged to respect e.g. naming\nconventions as defined in [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). On the\npractical side, the `freeplane-io` package is strongly related to the\nfunctionalities implemented within the [Freeplane](https://freeplane.org/)\nproject (JAVA language) and accessible by its built-in Groovy scripting\nenvironment. In effect, the `freeplane-io` package tries to provide a good\nexternal API representation for the features, the Groovy-API provides within\nthe Freeplane editor. Thus, another objective is to keep this package as close\nas possible to the Groovy-API. The syntax and naming will be some kind of mix.\n\n### deliberate deviations from conventions\n\nWhen browsing the code base of `freeplane-io`, you will see some deviations from\nthe PEP8 recommendations and from Freeplane's Groovy-API syntax. Some deviations result from the fact that the\ndeveloper was too inexperienced when he started this project, other deviations\nare intentional as they help extending the machine-based readability of the\ncode in the way the developer likes it. One eye-catching deviation will be the representation of comments within the code. For the `freeplane-io` package, there are two distinct kinds of comments:\n\n- **block comments** -> these comments are used as a kind of heading for the following block of code. It describes in veri few words (one line of text) what is being implemented within the next block of code.\n\n- **concept comments** -> these multi-line comments are used to describe the implementation concept. Somtimes, it is not too obvious, how a programmer implements something. So the concept comments might help understanding.\n\n\n### developing freeplane-python-io\n\nThe following steps should be performed in order to build a working local\ndevelopment environment. for this, the standard dos / bash / ... console should be used.\n\n1. clone this project into a new local project folder\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://...\n   ```\n\n2. create a Python virtual environment locally (make sure Python v3.x is being used, here)\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv env\n   ```\n\n3. install all necessary packages using pip\n    ```bash\n   pip install html2text\n\n   ```\n\n...\n\n\n\n",
