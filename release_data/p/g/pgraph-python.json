Also supports embedded graphs.  It is suitable for graphs with thousands of nodes.\n\n![road network](https://github.com/petercorke/pgraph-python/raw/master/examples/roads.png)\n\n```\nfrom pgraph import *\nimport json\n\n# load places and routes\nwith open('places.json', 'r') as f:\n    places = json.loads(f.read())\nwith open('routes.json', 'r') as f:\n    routes = json.loads(f.read())\n\n# build the graph\ng = UGraph()\n\nfor name, info in places.items():\n    g.add_vertex(name=name, coord=info[\"utm\"])\n\nfor route in routes:\n    g.add_edge(route[0], route[1], cost=route[2])\n\n# plan a path from Hughenden to Brisbane\np = g.path_Astar('Hughenden', 'Brisbane')\ng.plot(block=False) # plot it\ng.highlight_path(p)  # overlay the path\n```\n\n### Properties and methods of the graph\nGraphs belong to the class `UGraph` or `DGraph` for undirected or directed graphs respectively.  The graph is essentially a container for the vertices.\n\n- `g.add_vertex()` add a vertex\n- `g.n` the number of vertices\n- `g` is an iterator over vertices, can be used as `for vertex in g:`\n- `g[i]` reference a vertex by its index or name\n\n    ***\n- `g.add_edge()` connect two vertices\n- `g.edges()` all edges in the graph\n- `g.plot()` plots the vertices and edges\n- `g.nc` the number of graph components, 1 if fully connected\n- `g.component(v)` the component that vertex `v` belongs to\n\n    ***\n- `g.path_BFS()` breadth-first search\n- `g.path_Astar()` A* search\n\n    ***\n- `g.adjacency()` adjacency matrix\n- `g.Laplacian()` Laplacian matrix\n- `g.incidence()` incidence matrix\n\n### Properties and methods of a vertex\nVertices belong to the class `UVertex` (for undirected graphs) or `DVertex` (for directed graphs), which are each subclasses of `Vertex`.\n\n- `v.coord` the coordinate vector for embedded graph (optional)\n- `v.name` the name of the vertex (optional)\n- `v.neighbours()` is a list of the neighbouring vertices\n- `v1.samecomponent(v2)` predicate for vertices belonging to the same component\n\nVertices can be named and referenced by name.\n\n### Properties and methods of an edge\nEdges are instances of the class `Edge`.\nEdges are not referenced by the graph object, each edge references a pair of vertices, and the vertices reference the edges.  For a directed graph only the start vertex of an edge references the edge object, whereas for an undirected graph both vertices reference the edge object.\n\n- `e.cost` cost of edge for planning methods\n- `e.next(v)` vertex on edge `e` that is not `v`\n- `e.v1`, `e.v2` the two vertices that define the edge `e`\n\n## Modifying a graph\n\n- `g.remove(v)` remove vertex `v`\n- `e.remove()` remove edge `e`\n\n## Subclasing pgraph classes\n\nConsider a user class `Foo` that we would like to connect using a graph _overlay_, ie.\ninstances of `Foo` becomes vertices in a graph.\n\n- Have it subclass either `DVertex` or `UVertex` depending on graph type\n- Then place instances of `Foo` into the graph using `add_vertex` and create edges as required\n\n```\nclass Foo(UVertex):\n  # foo stuff goes here\n  \nf1 = Foo(...)\nf2 = Foo(...)\n\ng = UGraph() # create a new undirected graph\ng.add_vertex(f1)\ng.add_vertex(f2)\n\nf1.connect(f2, cost=3)\nfor f in f1.neighbours():\n    # say hi to the neighbours\n```\n\n## Under the hood\n\nThe key objects and their interactions are shown below.\n\n![data structures](https://github.com/petercorke/pgraph-python/raw/master/docs/source/datastructures.png)\n\n## MATLAB version\n\nThis is a re-engineered version of [PGraph.m](https://github.com/petercorke/spatialmath-matlab/blob/master/PGraph.m) which ships as part of the [Spatial Math Toolbox for MATLAB](https://github.com/petercorke/spatialmath-matlab).  This class is used to support bundle adjustment, pose-graph SLAM and various planners such as PRM, RRT and Lattice.\n\nThe Python version was designed from the start to work with directed and undirected graphs, whereas directed graphs were a late addition to the MATLAB version.  Semantics are similar but not identical.  In particular the use of subclassing rather than references to\n_user data_ is encouraged.",
