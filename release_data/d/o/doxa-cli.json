Otherwise, you will have to use `python -m doxa_cli` (or `python3 -m doxa_cli` on some systems) to access DOXA CLI commands.\n\n### Logging into the CLI with your DOXA account\n\nBefore you can upload agents to DOXA using the CLI, you must first log in with your DOXA account by running the following command:\n```bash\ndoxa login\n```\n\nIf supported, this will open an authorisation prompt in your default browser. If you are not already logged in on [doxaai.com](https://doxaai.com/), you will first be invited to do so. Thereafter, you wil be asked to authorise the DOXA CLI to have access to your DOXA account. Once you signify your approval, the DOXA CLI will automatically log you in within a few seconds.\n\nBy default, the DOXA CLI will store its configuration within `~/.doxa`, where `~` is your home directory, e.g. `/home/username` on Linux systems and `C:\\Users\\username\\` on Windows. If for whatever reason you would like to store the DOXA CLI configuration elsewhere (e.g. due to a permissions issue), you may use a different directory by setting the `DOXA_CONFIG_DIRECTORY` environment variable.\n\n### Logging out\n\nYou may log out by running the following command:\n```bash\ndoxa logout\n```\n\n### Retrieving user information\n\nYou can retrieve information on the user account with which you are currently logged in by performing the following command:\n```bash\ndoxa user\n```\n\n### Uploading agents to DOXA\n\nYou may upload and submit agents to DOXA using the following command:\n\n```bash\ndoxa upload [AGENT DIRECTORY]\n```\n\nThe agent directory must contain a `doxa.yaml` file informing DOXA how to process your submission.\n\nThe following is an example of the contents of one such `doxa.yaml` file:\n```yaml\ncompetition: uttt\nenvironment: cpu\nlanguage: python\nentrypoint: evaluate.py\n```\n",
