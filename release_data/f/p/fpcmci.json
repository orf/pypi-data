The algorithm, starting from a prefixed set of variables, identifies the correct subset of features and possible links between them which describe the observed process. Then, from the selected features and links, a causal model is built.\n\n\n## Why FPCMCI?\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art causal discovery approaches suffer in terms of speed and accuracy of the causal analysis when the process to be analysed is composed by a large number of features. FPCMCI is able to select the most meaningful features from a set of variables and build a causal model from such selection. To this end, the causal analysis results **faster** and **more accurate**.\n\nIn the following it is presented an example showing a comparison between causal models obtained by PCMCI and FPCMCI causal discovery algorithms on the same data. The latter have been created as follows:\n\n``` python\nmin_lag = 1\nmax_lag = 1\nnp.random.seed(1)\nnsample = 1500\nnfeature = 6\n\nd = np.random.random(size = (nsample, feature))\nfor t in range(max_lag, nsample):\n  d[t, 0] += 2 * d[t-1, 1] + 3 * d[t-1, 3]\n  d[t, 2] += 1.1 * d[t-1, 1]**2\n  d[t, 3] += d[t-1, 3] * d[t-1, 2]\n  d[t, 4] += d[t-1, 4] + d[t-1, 5] * d[t-1, 0]\n```\n\nCausal Model by PCMCI       |  Causal Model by FPCMCI \n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](https://github.com/lcastri/fpcmci/raw/main/images/PCMCI_example.png \"Causal model by PCMCI\")  |  ![](https://github.com/lcastri/fpcmci/raw/main/images/FPCMCI_example.png \"Causal model by FPCMCI\")\nExecution time ~ 6min 50sec | Execution time ~ 2min 45sec\n\nThe causal analysis performed by the **FPCMCI** results not only faster but also more accurate. Indeed, the causal model derived by the FPCMCI agrees with the structure of the system of equations, instead the onoe derived by the PCMCI presents spurious links:\n* $X_2$ &rarr; $X_4$\n* $X_2$ &rarr; $X_5$\n\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you found this useful for your work, please cite these papers:\n```\n@article{ghidoni2022human,\n  title={From Human Perception and Action Recognition to Causal Understanding of Human-Robot Interaction in Industrial Environments},\n  author={Ghidoni, Stefano and Terreran, Matteo and Evangelista, Daniele and Menegatti, Emanuele and Eitzinger, Christian and Villagrossi, Enrico and Pedrocchi, Nicola and Castaman, Nicola and Malecha, Marcin and Mghames, Sariah and others},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n```\n@inproceedings{castri2022causal,\n    title={Causal Discovery of Dynamic Models for Predicting Human Spatial Interactions},\n    author={Castri, Luca and Mghames, Sariah and Hanheide, Marc and Bellotto, Nicola},\n    booktitle={International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR)},\n    year={2022},\n}\n```\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n* matplotlib==3.6.1\n* netgraph==4.10.2\n* networkx==2.8.6\n* numpy==1.21.5\n* pandas==1.5.0\n* ruptures==1.1.7\n* scikit_learn==1.1.3\n* scipy==1.8.0\n* setuptools==56.0.0\n* tigramite==5.1.0.3\n\n\n## Installation\n\nBefore installing the FPCMCI package, you need to install the [IDTxl package](https://github.com/pwollstadt/IDTxl) used for the feature-selection process, following the guide described [here](https://github.com/pwollstadt/IDTxl/wiki/Installation-and-Requirements).
