This includes functionality for running the\nmodels \"in reverse\" in order to simulate instrument data for tests\nand mission simulations. This software will enable and support the\ncreation of various geospatial data sets (maps) to help visualize\nand understand data from the spacecraft. It will also support the\ncreation of PDS4 archive labels and structures for eventual data\ndelivery to the Planetary Data System (PDS).\n\nAt the moment, this repo is under significant development and change as we\nattempt to craft various pieces of code.  It is definitely a work-in-progress.\n\nThe VIPER Science Team is developing this software \"in the open\"\nin order to adhere to the new `NASA Science Information Policy for\nthe Science Mission Directorate (SPD-41)\n<https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf>`_\nas much as is possible.\n\n\n* Free software: Apache 2 License\n\n..    * Documentation: https://vipersci.readthedocs.io.\n..    * `PlanetaryPy`_ Affiliate Package.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nVersions will be posted to PyPI and conda to ease installation soon.\n\nFor the moment, follow the \"Get Started!\" directions in the CONTRIBUTING.rst document.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nFeedback, issues, and contributions are always gratefully welcomed. See the\ncontributing guide for details on how to help and setup a development\nenvironment.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nvipersci was developed in the open at NASA's Ames Research Center.\n\nSee the `AUTHORS\n<https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/vipersci/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst>`_\nfile for a complete list of developers.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSee LICENSE file for the full text of the license that applies to vipersci.\n\nCopyright (c) 2022, United States Government as represented by\nthe Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.
