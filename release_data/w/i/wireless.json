If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",

Please reach out if you are interested in helping to maintain this project.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joshvillbrandt/wireless.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joshvillbrandt/wireless) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wireless/badge/?version=latest)](http://wireless.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)\n\n# wireless\n\nA dead simple, cross-platform Python library to connect to wireless networks.\n\n## Description\n\nThis library can control a computer's wireless adapter to connect to a network. Environments currently supported include (in order of preference):\n\nNetwork Manager | Operating Systems | Tested Adapters\n--- | --- | ---\nnmcli | Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 | Linksys AE3000, Intel Centrino 6250\nwpa_supplicant | Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 | Intel Centrino 6250\nnetworksetup | Mac OS 10.10 | Macbook Pro\n\n## Setup\n\n```bash\nsudo pip install wireless\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nA typical usage looks like this:\n\n```python\nfrom wireless import Wireless\nwireless = Wireless()\nwireless.connect(ssid='ssid', password='password')\n```\n\nNote: To use `nmcli` on Ubuntu 14.04, the right permissions must be in place. A few options are listed [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Set_up_PolicyKit_permissions).\n\nNote: To use `wpa_supplicant`, `network-manager` (the backend for `nmcli`) must not be running. This is because `network-manager` runs an instance of `wpa_supplicant` behind the scenes which will conflict with the `wpa_supplicant` instance that this library would create. If you have a `network-manager` on your machine but would prefer to use `wpa_supplicant` (not recommended), run `sudo service network-manager stop` before using `wireless`.\n\n## API\n\n* `Wireless([interface])` - initialize the wireless driver\n* `connect(ssid, password)` - attempts to connect to a network and returns True on success\n* `current()` - returns the name of the current network or None otherwise\n* `interfaces()` - list the available interfaces\n* `interface([interface])` - get or set the current interface\n* `power([True||False])` - get or set the power status of the adapter\n* `driver()` - return the name of driver being used for wireless control\n\n## Change History\n\nThis project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).\n\n### v0.3.3 - 2019/06/27\n\n* Fix version comparison for python3.5 ([pschmitt](https://github.com/pschmitt))\n* Update iwconfig current() to handle Nickname field ([jminardi](https://github.com/jminardi))\n\n### v0.3.2 - 2016/03/06\n\n* Added a few tests and fixed a py34 bug ([XayOn](https://github.com/XayOn))\n\n### v0.3.1 - 2015/04/24\n\n* Added version check for nmcli ([Silarn](https://github.com/Silarn))\n\n### v0.3.0 - 2015/01/13\n\n* Added support for `wpa_supplicant`\n* Added the `driver()` method\n\n### v0.2.1 - 2014/12/01\n\n* remove dependency on `pandoc`\n\n### v0.2.0 - 2014/11/25\n\n* Added support for multiple network adapters with `interface()` and `interfaces()` methods\n* The `current()` method actually asks the wireless driver for the current SSID instead of returning the name of the most recently connected network\n* Added the `power()` method\n\n### v0.1.1 - 2014/11/24\n\n* Better documentation formatting for PyPI\n\n### v0.1.0 - 2014/11/22\n\n* Initial release\n\n## Contributions\n\nPull requests to the `develop` branch are welcomed!\n\n## Publishing\n\nFirst, install `pandoc` so that setup.py can auto-convert Markdown syntax into reStructuredText:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install pandoc\nsudo pip install pypandoc\n```\n\nThen, following [this guide](http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html), push the project to PyPI:\n\n```bash\nsudo python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi\n```",
