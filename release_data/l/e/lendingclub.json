            "description": "Lending Club API\n================\n\nA stand-alone python API for Lending Club. In a nutshell, this module lets you check your cash balance, search for notes, build orders and invest.\n\nIt is still a work in progress but I expect the first stable release by the end of July. The current release works well but may have some bugs -- use at your own risk.\n\nThe code has been ported out of the `LendingClub Auto Investor <https://github.com/jgillick/LendingClubAutoInvestor>`_ project.\n\nDisclaimer\n----------\n\nI have tested this tool to the best of my ability, but understand that it may have bugs. Use at your own risk!\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nThe following Python libraries are required:\n\n* requests\n* beautifulsoup4\n* html5lib\n* pybars\n\nThese can automatically be installed with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_::\n\n    sudo pip install requests beautifulsoup4 html5lib pybars\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nTo install, run::\n\n    sudo python ./setup.py install\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nHere's a step-by-step example of searching for grade B loans and investing $25 in the first one::\n\n    >>> from lendingclub import LendingClub\n    >>> from lendingclub.filters import Filter\n    >>> lc = LendingClub()\n    >>> lc.authenticate()\n    Email:test@test.com\n    Password:\n    True\n    >>> filters = Filter()\n    >>> filters['grades']['B'] = True      # Filter for only B grade loans\n    >>> results = lc.search(filters)       # Search using this filter\n    >>> len(results['loans'])              # See how many results returned\n    100\n    >>> results['loans'][0]['loan_id']     # See the loan_id of the first loan\n    1763030\n    >>> order = lc.start_order()           # Start a new investment order\n    >>> order.add(5763030, 25)             # Add the first loan to the order with a $25 investment\n    >>> order.execute()                    # Execute the order\n    1861879\n    >>> order.order_id                     # See the order ID\n    1861879\n    >>> order.assign_to_portfolio('Foo')   # Assign the loans in this order to a portfolio called 'Foo'\n    True\n\nCreate a diversified portfolio of loan notes. Here we want to invest $400 in a portfolio with only B, C, D and E grade notes with an average overall return between 17% - 19%::\n\n    >>> from lendingclub import LendingClub\n    >>> from lendingclub.filters import Filter\n    >>> lc = LendingClub()\n    >>> lc.authenticate()\n    Email:test@test.com\n    Password:\n    True\n    >>> filters = Filter()                # Set the filters\n    >>> filters['grades']['B'] = True     # See Pro Tips for a shorter way to do this\n    >>> filters['grades']['C'] = True\n    >>> filters['grades']['D'] = True\n    >>> filters['grades']['E'] = True\n    >>> lc.get_cash_balance()             # See the cash you have available for investing\n    463.80000000000001\n                                          # Find a portfolio to invest in ($400 & between 17-19%)\n    >>> portfolio = lc.build_portfolio(400, 17.0, 19.0, filters)\n    >>> len(portfolio['loan_fractions'])  # See how many loans are in this portfolio\n    16\n    >>> order = lc.start_order()          # Start a new order\n    >>> order.add_batch(portfolio)        # Add the portfolio to the order\n    >>> order.execute()                   # Execute the order\n    1861880\n\nGet a list of the loan notes that you've invested in (by default this will only return 100 at a time)::\n\n    >>> from lendingclub import LendingClub\n    >>> lc = LendingClub()\n    >>> lc.authenticate()\n    Email:test@test.com\n    Password:\n    True\n    >>> notes = lc.get_notes()                  # Get the first 100 loan notes\n    >>> len(notes['loans'])\n    100\n    >>> notes['total']                          # See the total number of loan notes you have\n    630\n    >>> notes = lc.get_notes(start_index=100)   # Get the next 100 loan notes\n    >>> len(notes['loans'])\n    100\n    >>> notes = lc.get_notes(get_all=True)       # Get all notes in one request (may be slow)\n    >>> len(notes['loans'])\n    630\n\nPro Tips\n--------\n\nYou can define some of your filters in the init line::\n\n    filters = Filter({'grades': {'B': True, 'C': True, 'D': True, 'E': True}})\n\nThis will merge these values with the rest of the filters.\n\nLicense\n=======\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jeremy Gillick\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
