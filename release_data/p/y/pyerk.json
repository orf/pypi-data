However, in principle, it aims to be applicable wo a wide range of domains.\n\n\n# Assumed Directory Structure\n\n```\n<erk-root>/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pyerk/                          \u2190 repo with the code of the core package\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 .git/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md                    \u2190 the currently displayed file (README.md)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py                     \u2190 deployment script\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/pyerk/auxiliary.py       \u2190 module containing function get_erk_root_dir()\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 django-erk-gui/                 \u2190 repo with the code for the django gui (project and! app)\n\u2502  \u2502                                  (this package is optional)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 .git/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 manage.py\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 erk-data/                       \u2190 directory that contains erk-knowledge packages (for actual usage)\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 ocse/                        \u2190 a knowledge package (ontology of control systems engineering)\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 .git/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 ocse.py                   \u2190 a knowledge module\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502                             (this one is currently used for unit testing)\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 xyz123/                      \u2190 another knowledge package\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 erk-data-for-unittests/         \u2190 directory that contains erk-knowledge packages\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...

However, to get an overview of the most importent features you might want to have a look at the source code, especially at the files [builtin_entities.py](/src/pyerk/builtin_entities.py) and the [test_core.py](tests/test_core.py).\n\n\nNevertheless, some topics are explained here until there is some more comprehensive documentation.\n\n## Visualization\n\nCurrently there is some basic visualization support via the command line. To visualize your a module (including its relations to the builtin_entities) you can use a command like\n\n```\npyerk -rwd --load-mod demo-module.py demo -vis __all__\n```\n\n## Interactive Usage\n\nTo open an IPython shell with a loaded module run e.g.\n\n```\npyerk -i -rwd -l control_theory1.py ct\n```\n\nThen, you have `ct` as variable in your namespace and can e.g. run `print(ct.I5167.R1`).\n\n(The above command assumes that the file `control_theory1.py` is in your current working directory.)\n\n## Multilinguality\n\nPyerk aims to support an arbitrary number of languages by so called *language specified strings*. Currently support for English and German is preconfigured in `pyerk.settings`. These language specified strings are instances of the class `rdflib.Literal` where the `.language`-attribute is set to one of the values from `pyerk.setting.SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` and can be created like:\n\n```python\nfrom pyerk import de, en\n\n# ...\n\nlss1 = \"some english words\"@en\nlss2 = \"ein paar deutsche W\u00f6rter\"@de\n```\n\nwhere `en, de` are instances of `pyerk.core.LangaguageCode`.\n\nThe usage inside pyerk is best demonstrated by the unittest `test_c02__multilingual_relations`, see [test_core.py](tests/test_core.py).\n\n\n# Coding style\n\nWe use `black -l 120 ./` to ensure coding style consistency.\n",
