I was able to make a small contribution despite having little experience using Flask. Whenever I had questions, they were answered well on discord. I recommend working with Abdur-Rahmaan and shams! If you're nervous about contributing, they make the experience much less intimidating than I had anticipated. --[@taanguyen](https://github.com/taanguyen)\n\n> I'd like to thank @Abdur-rahmaanJ for creating this project! Though I have limited experience working with Flask, and was unable to understand the code and its functioning at first, Abdur-rahmaanJ explained everything very patiently and helped me clear all the doubts! I was able to learn new concepts and it was an amazing experience overall. I'd recommend opensource newbies like me and even experienced contributors to make contributions to this project. \ud83d\udcaf --[@geeythree](https://github.com/geeythree)\n\n## \u26a1 Quick try\n\n\n```\n$ python -m pip install shopcube\n$ shopcube initialise\n$ shopcube rundebug\n```\n\nGo to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)\n\n\n## \ud83c\udf7c First time setup\n\n- Download and install the [latest version of git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n\n- Configure git with your [username](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git) and [email](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address).\n\n  ```\n  $ git config --global user.name 'your name'\n  $ git config --global user.email 'your email'\n  ```\n\n- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).\n\n- Fork shopcube to your GitHub account by clicking the [Fork](https://github.com/shopyo/shopcube/fork) button.\n\n- [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork) the main repository locally (make sure to have your [SSH authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) setup!).

The -u option allows your local branch to be pushed to your GitHub repo.\n\n  ```\n  $ git push -u origin your-branch-name\n  ```\n\n- [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). You should see the PR link in the terminal after you successfully push your commits. Link to the issue being addressed with `fixes #123` in the pull request. See [example PR](https://github.com/shopyo/shopyo/pull/55).\n\n## \ud83d\udd28 Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIf you need further assistance, ping [@contributor](https://discord.gg/k37Ef6w) on discord.\n\n- When I initialise the app, I get an error related to MySQL (ie: a Connection Error)\n\n  In `config.py`, make sure you have a database URI\n\n    ```\n    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = \"mysql+pymysql://{username}:{password}@{server_name}/{db_name}\".format(\n        username='shopcube',\n        password='pass1234-A',\n        server_name='localhost',\n        db_name='shopcube'\n    )\n    ```\n\n  or paste the following into `config.py` inside of the `class DevelopmentConfig(Config)`:\n\n  ```\n  SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(base_path, 'app.db')\n  ```\n\n- I launched the app but nothing shows up in /dashboard.\n\n  - Log in as admin@domain.com with the password 'pass'\n\n- Additional development insights?\n\n  - Read the [shopyo](https://shopyo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) docs!\n\n\n## \u2728 Useful commands\n\n```\n$ flask flight-info\n\nPython version: 3.10.7 (main, Sep  7 2022, 15:22:19) [GCC 9.4.0]\nShopyo version: 4.5.8\nShopcube version : 4.2.0\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI: sqlite:///shopcube.db\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udf73 In Action\n\n![](screenshots/new_screenshots/1.png)\n![](screenshots/new_screenshots/2.png)\n![](screenshots/new_screenshots/3.png)\n![](screenshots/new_screenshots/4.png)\n",
