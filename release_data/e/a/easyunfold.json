Create a primitive cell, and generate a k point path for this primitive cell.\n2. Create a supercell, and obtain its optimised structure.\n3. Generate a series of kpoints in the supercell to be calculated.\n4. Perform a band structure calculation using the supercell, and save its wave function.\n5. Run post-processing to obtain the unfolded band structure.\n\nThe supercell usually contains certain defects, or a special quasi random structure.\nIn both cases, its symmetry is lowered when compared to the perfect primitive cell.\nHence, for a given kpoint path in the primitive cell, additional kpoints may need to be sampled, and the extracted spectral weights need to be averaged in the end to obtained the effective band structure (EBS).\n\nAt the moment, only VASP calculations are supported, although in principle other PW code can be supported easily if the wavefunction can be read in.\n\nPlease see the documentation for guide and examples.\n\n## Contributors\n\nCode Contributors:\n  [Bonan Zhu](https://github.com/zhubonan)\n  [Sean kavanagh](https://github.com/kavanase)\n\nAnd those who helped in the development:\n\n  [Joe Wills](https://github.com/joebesity)\n  [David O. Scanlon](http://davidscanlon.com/?page_id=5)\n\n",
