After cloning this repo, you can load the HTML files in a web browser, which allows you to navigate to other sections.\n\n# Supported translations\n\n## English\n\n- ASV\n- AKJV\n- BRG\n- EHV\n- ESV\n- ESVUK\n- GNV\n- GW\n- ISV\n- JUB\n- KJV\n- KJ21\n- LEB\n- MEV\n- NASB\n- NASB1995\n- NET\n- NIV\n- NIVUK\n- NKJV\n- NLT\n- NLV\n- NOG\n- NRSV\n- NRSVUE\n- WEB\n- YLT\n\n## Espa\u00f1ol\n\n- RVA\n\n# Usage\n\n## Web Extractor\nThe Web Extractor is used to obtain passage information directly from [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com).\n```python\nfrom meaningless import WebExtractor\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    bible = WebExtractor()\n    passage = bible.get_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n    print(passage)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\n```\n\n## YAML Downloader\nThe YAML Downloader is which formats passages obtained from the Bible Gateway website (using the Web Extractor) into a YAML structure and writes it out to a file:\n```python\nfrom meaningless import YAMLDownloader\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = YAMLDownloader()\n    downloader.download_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n```\nOutput:\n\nRunning the above code would produce a file called `Ecclesiastes.yaml` in the current working directory with the following contents:\n```\nEcclesiastes:\n  1:\n    2: \"\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\\n    says the Teacher.\\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\\n\\\n      \\    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\"\nInfo:\n  Language: English\n  Translation: NIV\n```\n\n## YAML Extractor\nThe YAML Extractor uses the generated files from the YAML Downloader to find passages. This is faster than the Web Extractor, since it is not retrieving information from the Internet and is also unaffected by bandwidth limitations.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import YAMLExtractor\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    bible = YAMLExtractor()\n    passage = bible.get_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n    print(passage)\n```\nOutput:\n\nAssuming the YAML downloader has already generated a YAML file in the current directory called `Ecclesiastes.yaml` which contains the book of Ecclesiastes in YAML format:\n```\n\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\n```\n\n## YAML File Interface\nThe YAML File Interface is a set of helper methods used to read and write YAML files. This can be useful if you need to do some customised processing on a downloaded YAML file.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import YAMLDownloader, yaml_file_interface\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = YAMLDownloader()\n    downloader.download_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n    bible = yaml_file_interface.read('./Ecclesiastes.yaml')\n    bible['Info']['Customised?'] = True\n    yaml_file_interface.write('./Ecclesiastes.yaml', bible)\n```\nOutput:\n\nRunning the above code would produce a file called `Ecclesiastes.yaml` in the current working directory with the following contents:\n```python\nEcclesiastes:\n  1:\n    2: \"\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\\n    says the Teacher.\\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\\n\\\n      \\    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\"\nInfo:\n  Language: English\n  Translation: NIV\n  Customised?: true\n```\n\n## JSON Downloader\nThe JSON Downloader is effectively the same as the YAML Downloader except the resulting file is in JSON format and has a different file extension.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import JSONDownloader\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = JSONDownloader()\n    downloader.download_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n```\nOutput:\n\nRunning the above code would produce a file called `Ecclesiastes.json` in the current working directory with the following contents:\n```\n{\n  \"Ecclesiastes\": {\n    \"1\": {\n      \"2\": \"\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\\n    says the Teacher.\\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"Info\": {\n    \"Language\": \"English\",\n    \"Translation\": \"NIV\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## JSON Extractor\nMuch like the YAML Extractor, the JSON Extractor uses the generated files from the JSON Downloader to find passages.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import JSONExtractor\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    bible = JSONExtractor()\n    passage = bible.get_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n    print(passage)\n```\nOutput:\n\nAssuming the JSON downloader has already generated a JSON file in the current directory called `Ecclesiastes.json` which contains the book of Ecclesiastes in JSON format:\n```\n\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\n```\n\n## JSON File Interface\nThe JSON File Interface is a set of helper methods used to read and write JSON files. Similar to the YAML File Interface, it can be used to do customised processing on a JSON file or its contents.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import JSONDownloader, json_file_interface\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = JSONDownloader()\n    downloader.download_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n    bible = json_file_interface.read('./Ecclesiastes.json')\n    bible['Info']['Customised?'] = True\n    json_file_interface.write('./Ecclesiastes.json', bible)\n```\nOutput:\n\nRunning the above code would produce a file called `Ecclesiastes.json` in the current working directory with the following contents:\n```python\n{\n  \"Ecclesiastes\": {\n    \"1\": {\n      \"2\": \"\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\\n    says the Teacher.\\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"Info\": {\n    \"Customised?\": true,\n    \"Language\": \"English\",\n    \"Translation\": \"NIV\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## XML Downloader\nThe XML Downloader is effectively the same as the YAML Downloader except the resulting file is in a specific XML format and has a different file extension.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import XMLDownloader\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = XMLDownloader()\n    downloader.download_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n```\nOutput:\n\nRunning the above code would produce a file called `Ecclesiastes.xml` in the current working directory with the following contents:\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<root>\n  <Info>\n    <Language>English</Language>\n    <Translation>NIV</Translation>\n  </Info>\n  <Ecclesiastes>\n    <_1>\n      <_2>\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d</_2>\n    </_1>\n  </Ecclesiastes>\n</root>\n```\n\nNote that the following adjustments are made to the downloaded contents to ensure it is a well-formed XML document:\n\n1. A top-level \"root\" tag is present.\n2. All tag names starting with a number are prefixed.\n3. Tags corresponding to book names use a placeholder character for spaces.\n\n## XML Extractor\nMuch like the YAML Extractor, the XML Extractor uses the generated files from the XML Downloader to find passages.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import XMLExtractor\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    bible = XMLExtractor()\n    passage = bible.get_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n    print(passage)\n```\nOutput:\n\nAssuming the XML downloader has already generated a XML file in the current directory called `Ecclesiastes.xml` which contains the book of Ecclesiastes in XML format:\n```\n\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\n```\n\n## XML File Interface\nThe XML File Interface is a set of helper methods used to read and write XML files. Unlike the other file interfaces, this is more geared towards the XML document format used by the XML Downloader and Extractor, so you may observe some strange behaviour if you try using this for general purpose XML file interactions.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import XMLDownloader, xml_file_interface\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = XMLDownloader()\n    downloader.download_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n    bible = xml_file_interface.read('./Ecclesiastes.xml')\n    bible['Info']['Customised'] = True\n    xml_file_interface.write('./Ecclesiastes.xml', bible)\n```\nOutput:\n\nRunning the above code would produce a file called `Ecclesiastes.xml` in the current working directory with the following contents:\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<root>\n  <Info>\n    <Language>English</Language>\n    <Translation>NIV</Translation>\n    <Customised>true</Customised>\n  </Info>\n  <Ecclesiastes>\n    <_1>\n      <_2>\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d</_2>\n    </_1>\n  </Ecclesiastes>\n</root>\n```\n\n**Note that you allowed to write badly formed XML documents using this file interface, but they will cause runtime errors in your code upon trying to read and process them.**\n\n## CSV Downloader\nThe CSV Downloader is effectively the same as the YAML Downloader except the resulting file is in CSV format and has a different file extension.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import CSVDownloader\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = CSVDownloader()\n    downloader.download_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n```\nOutput:\n\nRunning the above code would produce a file called `Ecclesiastes.csv` in the current working directory with the following contents:\n```\nBook,Chapter,Passage,Text,Language,Translation\nEcclesiastes,1,2,\"\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\",English,NIV\n```\n\n## CSV Extractor\nMuch like the YAML Extractor, the CSV Extractor uses the generated files from the CSV Downloader to find passages.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import CSVExtractor\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    bible = CSVExtractor()\n    passage = bible.get_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n    print(passage)\n```\nOutput:\n\nAssuming the CSV downloader has already generated a CSV file in the current directory called `Ecclesiastes.csv` which contains the book of Ecclesiastes in CSV format:\n```\n\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\n```\n\n## CSV File Interface\nThe CSV File Interface is a set of helper methods used to read and write CSV files. Like the XML File Interface, this is geared towards the CSV document format used by the CSV Downloader and Extractor and cannot be used to add custom attributes to the output file when writing CSV data.\n```python\nfrom meaningless import CSVDownloader, csv_file_interface\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = CSVDownloader()\n    downloader.download_passage('Ecclesiastes', 1, 2)\n    bible = csv_file_interface.read('./Ecclesiastes.csv')\n    bible['Info']['Language'] = 'English (EN)'\n    csv_file_interface.write('./Ecclesiastes.csv', bible)\n```\nOutput:\n\nRunning the above code would produce a file called `Ecclesiastes.csv` in the current working directory with the following contents:\n```\nBook,Chapter,Passage,Text,Language,Translation\nEcclesiastes,1,2,\"\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\",English (EN),NIV\n```\n\n## Text searching within files\nAll file-based extractors support passage filtering by search text or by regular expression.\n\nThe section below is a simple example that prints passages containing \"meaningless\" from Ecclesiastes 1:\n```python\nfrom meaningless import YAMLDownloader, YAMLExtractor\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = YAMLDownloader()\n    downloader.download_chapter('Ecclesiastes', 1)\n\n    bible = YAMLExtractor()\n    print(bible.find_text_in_chapter('meaningless', 'Ecclesiastes', 1))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\n\u00b9\u2074 I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.\n```\n\nThe section below is another simple example that prints passages containing \"meaningless\" or \"wisdom\" from Ecclesiastes 1:\n```python\nfrom meaningless import YAMLDownloader, YAMLExtractor\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    downloader = YAMLDownloader()\n    downloader.download_chapter('Ecclesiastes', 1)\n\n    bible = YAMLExtractor()\n    print(bible.find_text_in_chapter('meaningless|wisdom', 'Ecclesiastes', 1, is_regex=True))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n\u00b2 \u201cMeaningless! Meaningless!\u201d\n    says the Teacher.\n\u201cUtterly meaningless!\n    Everything is meaningless.\u201d\n\u00b9\u00b3 I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind!\n\u00b9\u2074 I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.\n\u00b9\u2076 I said to myself, \u201cLook, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.\u201d\n\u00b9\u2077 Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.\n\u00b9\u2078 For with much wisdom comes much sorrow;\n    the more knowledge, the more grief.\n```\n\n# Q&A\n\n## How to report potential bugs and other feedback?\n\nTo report bugs and other problems, create an issue in this repo that details:\n- A brief description of the problem encountered\n- Steps to recreate the problem (or a code sample that demonstrates the problem)\n- Expected result\n- The version of this library being used\n\nIf you have any questions, complaints, compliments or even ideas to improve this library, you can also leave them as a GitHub issue with the appropriate label.\nOr you can also send an email to [dantran.au@gmail.com](mailto:dantran.au@gmail.com), although a response will likely take longer than replying to a GitHub issue.\n\n## Should I manually edit the downloaded file?\n\n**This is NOT recommended** under normal circumstances, as it may cause problems with the library API when using the modified file.\n\n## If multiple translations are supported, why aren't there more unit tests for these?\n\nThe Base Extractor and Downloader all use the same overall structure to represent passage contents for all translations.\n\nFor the Web Extractor, the page structure of the [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com) site is mostly the same across different translations, so as long as the translation-specific differences are handled correctly, the same set of unit tests should suffice.\n\n## Will this library ever drop support for certain translations?\n\nShort answer: It depends.\n\nThe primary case for dropping support for a certain Bible translation is if there is an observed problem in the extracted Bible contents which is considerably difficult to address due to how the Biblical contents is structured (in terms of HTML) on the [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com) site. With that in mind, reinstating support for Bible translations can be reconsidered when such problems subside.\n\n## How are omitted passages determined for each translation?\n\nWithout having to go through every single passage and check if it is omitted, a set of common omitted passages are found here: \n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_Testament_verses_not_included_in_modern_English_translations\n- http://textus-receptus.com/wiki/List_of_Omitted_Bible_Verses#List_of_Bible_verses_totally_omitted\n\nThese passages are checked on the [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com) site, and then added to the Base Downloader's internal list of omitted passages for the relevant translation.\n\nIf you notice any problems such as unhandled omitted passages or incorrect tagging of an omitted passage in the Base Downloader, please create an issue to report it.\n\n## Does this library provide support for the Apocrypha books?\n\nAt the moment, you can use the Web Extractor's `search()`, `search_multiple()` and other related functions to obtain passages from the Apocrypha books.\nThere is currently no official support for the Apocrypha books in the other downloaders and extractors, at least until the issues identified [here](https://github.com/daniel-tran/meaningless/pull/10#issuecomment-1236274786) become easier to work around.\n\n# Contributors\n- [daniel-tran](https://github.com/daniel-tran) (Creator & current maintainer)\n\nTo make a contribution to this library, refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis library is not endorsed by nor affiliated with Bible Gateway or any of its partners.\n\n# Change Log\n\n## 0.6.1\n- Fixed an issue where the JSON file interface was writing Unicode characters incorrectly to output files\n\n## 0.6.0\n- Added text searching functionality into Base Extractor\n- Added a dedicated area for experimental functionality and helper scripts\n  - With enough refinement, some of these might become new features in future releases\n- Added translation support for: NRSVUE\n- Removed translation support for: CJB\n\n## 0.5.0\n- Added CSV Extractor and CSV Downloader\n- Added csv_file_interface module to assist with CSV file access\n- Added translation support for: NIVUK\n- Drop library support for Python 3.6\n\n## 0.4.0\n- Documentation is now publicly available through GitHub Pages. See https://daniel-tran.github.io/meaningless/\n  - This was previously an undocumented change as part of the 0.3.0 release.\n- Added XML Extractor and XML Downloader\n- Added xml_file_interface module to assist with XML file access\n- Added translation support for: RVA\n\n## 0.3.0\n- Added initial continuous integration workflow with GitHub Actions\n- Added translation support for: BRG, CJB, EHV, ESVUK, GNV, GW, ISV, JUB, NASB1995, NOG\n- Drop library support for Python 3.5\n\n## 0.2.0\n- Added Base Extractor, Base Downloader, JSON Extractor and JSON Downloader\n  - Base Extractor contains shared logic for both the YAML and JSON Extractors\n  - Base Downloader contains shared logic for both the YAML and JSON Downloaders\n- Added json_file_interface module to assist with generic JSON file access\n- Added translation support for: ASV, AKJV, KJ21, LEB, MEV, NET, NLV, YLT\n\n## 0.1.0\n\n- Initial release!\n- Added Web Extractor, YAML Extractor and YAML Downloader\n- Added yaml_file_interface module to assist with generic YAML file access\n- Added translation support for: ESV, KJV, NASB, NIV, NKJV, NLT, NRSV, WEB\n\n\n",
