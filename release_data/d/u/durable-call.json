            "description": "Durable Call: Durable Local and Remote Function Calls\n=====================================================\n\nDurable call is a library for implementing durable functions\nfrom fragile functions.\n\nA function is said to be fragile\nif any of the following conditions are true:\na) the function may fail intermittently,\nb) the function call has side effects,\nand thus for a given input it should only be run once.\n\nA durable function is a fault tolerant and idempotent version\nof a fragile function.\nThis fault tolerance and idempotency is implemented by the runtime.\nWhen a durable function is called,\nthe runtime system first saves the parameters of the function call\nonto a file on disk.\nNext it repeatedly tries to call the function\nuntil it is able to execute it.\nOnce the function has been executed,\nthe result is also saved\nonto a file on disk.\nIf the function is called in the future with the same arguments,\nthe system will just return the saved result\nfrom the previous invocation.\n\nDurable function call persists across process invocations.\nIf a durable function call is initiated,\nand the process dies before it has been completed,\nthe runtime with continue to execute it\nif the process is restarted.\n",
