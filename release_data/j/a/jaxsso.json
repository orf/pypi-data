The implementation of AD avoids deriving derivatives manually or trauncation errors from numerical differentiation.\n* Acclerated linear algebra (XLA) and just-in-time compilation: these features in JAX boost the gradient evaluation\n* Hardware acceleration: run on GPUs and TPUs for **faster** experience.\n\n## Background: shape optimization\nWe consider the minimization of the ***strain energy*** by changing the **shape** of structures, which is equivalent to maximizing the stiffness and reducing the\nbending in the structure. The mathematical formulation of this problem is as follows, where no additional constraints are considered.\n$$\\text{minimize} \\quad C(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\sigma\\epsilon \\mathrm{d}V = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{f}^\\mathrm{T}\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) $$\n$$\\text{subject to: } \\quad \\mathbf{K}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) =\\mathbf{f}$$\nwhere $C$ is the compliance, which is equal to the work done by the external load; $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_d}$ is a vector of $n_d$ design variables that determine the shape of the structure; $\\sigma$, $\\epsilon$ and $V$ are the stress, strain and volume, respectively; $\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ are the generalized load vector and nodal displacement of $n$ structural nodes; $\\mathbf{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6n\\times6n}$ is the stiffness matrix. The constraint is essentially the governing equation in finite element analysis (FEA).\n\nTo implement **gradient-based optimization**, one needs to calculate $\\nabla C$. By applying the ***adjoint method***, the entry of $\\nabla C$ is as follows:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x_i}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{u}^\\mathrm{T}\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{K}}{\\partial x_i}\\mathbf{u}$$ The use of the adjoint method: i) reduces the computation complexity and ii) decouples FEA and the derivative calculation of the stiffness matrix $\\mathbf K$.\nTo get $\\nabla C$:\n1. Conduct FEA to get $\\mathbf u$\n2. Conduct sensitivity analysis to get $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{K}}{\\partial x_i}$. which is done by the module in JaxSSO called `Model_Sens.py` using AD.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Installation\nInstall it with pip: `pip install JaxSSO`\n\n### Dependencies\nJaxSSO is written in Python and requires:\n* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)\n* [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): \"JAX is [Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd) and [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla), brought together for high-performance machine learning research.\" Please refer to [this link](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for the installation of JAX.\n* [Nlopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Nlopt is a library for nonlinear optimization. It has Python interface, which is implemented herein. Refer to [this link](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Installation/) for the installation of Nlopt. Alternatively, you can use `pip install nlopt`, please refer to [\nnlopt-python](https://pypi.org/project/nlopt/).\n\nOptional:\n* [PyNite](https://github.com/JWock82/PyNite): A 3D structural engineering finite element library for Python, which is used herein for structural analysis. You choose any FEA solver you'd prefer (e.g. opensees) and couple it with JaxSSO.\n\n### Quickstart\nThe project provides you with interactive examples with Google Colab for quick start:\n* [2D-arch](https://github.com/GaoyuanWu/JaxSSO/blob/main/Examples/Arch_2D.ipynb): form-finding of a 2d-arch\n* [3D-arch](https://github.com/GaoyuanWu/JaxSSO/blob/main/Examples/Arch_3D.ipynb): form-finding of a 3d-arch\n* [Mannheim Multihalle](https://github.com/GaoyuanWu/JaxSSO/blob/main/Examples/Mannheim_Multihalle.ipynb): form-finding of Mannheim Multihalle\n* [Four-point supported gridshell](https://github.com/GaoyuanWu/JaxSSO/blob/main/Examples/FourPt_FreeForm.ipynb): form-finding of a gridshell with four coner nodes pinned.
