However, it is a vulnerability that the InvenTree development team takes seriously.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe proposed patch for this vulnerability is prevents injection of un-escaped fields into front-end UI elements.\n\nA future patch will also address sanitization of database fields on the \"back end\", however this will require a much larger effort to refactor multiple database tables.\n\n### Patches\n\n- The issue is addressed in the upcoming `0.8.0` release\n- This fix will also be back-ported to the `0.7.x` branch, applied to the `0.7.2` release\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds for this issue, users should upgrade to a patched version.\n\n### References\n\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/4cae8442-c042-43c2-ad89-6f666eaf3d57/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/9d640ef2-c52c-4106-b043-f7497d577078/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/b114e82f-6c02-485b-82ea-e242f89169c2/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/22783cd3-1b2c-48fc-b31f-03b53c86da0b/\n\nThank you @saharshtapi for bringing this issue to our attention and giving pointers for fixing them.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [github](http://github.com/inventree/inventree)\n* Email us at [security@inventree.org](mailto:security@inventree.org)\n",

However, it is a vulnerability that the InvenTree development team takes seriously.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe proposed patch for this vulnerability is prevents injection of un-escaped fields into front-end UI elements.\n\nA future patch will also address sanitization of database fields on the \"back end\", however this will require a much larger effort to refactor multiple database tables.\n\n### Patches\n\n- The issue is addressed in the upcoming `0.8.0` release\n- This fix will also be back-ported to the `0.7.x` branch, applied to the `0.7.2` release\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds for this issue, users should upgrade to a patched version.\n\n### References\n\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/4cae8442-c042-43c2-ad89-6f666eaf3d57/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/9d640ef2-c52c-4106-b043-f7497d577078/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/b114e82f-6c02-485b-82ea-e242f89169c2/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/22783cd3-1b2c-48fc-b31f-03b53c86da0b/\n\nThank you @saharshtapi for bringing this issue to our attention and giving pointers for fixing them.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [github](http://github.com/inventree/inventree)\n* Email us at [security@inventree.org](mailto:security@inventree.org)\n",

However, it is a vulnerability that the InvenTree development team takes seriously.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe proposed patch for this vulnerability is prevents injection of un-escaped fields into front-end UI elements.\n\nA future patch will also address sanitization of database fields on the \"back end\", however this will require a much larger effort to refactor multiple database tables.\n\n### Patches\n\n- The issue is addressed in the upcoming `0.8.0` release\n- This fix will also be back-ported to the `0.7.x` branch, applied to the `0.7.2` release\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds for this issue, users should upgrade to a patched version.\n\n### References\n\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/4cae8442-c042-43c2-ad89-6f666eaf3d57/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/9d640ef2-c52c-4106-b043-f7497d577078/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/b114e82f-6c02-485b-82ea-e242f89169c2/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/22783cd3-1b2c-48fc-b31f-03b53c86da0b/\n\nThank you @saharshtapi for bringing this issue to our attention and giving pointers for fixing them.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [github](http://github.com/inventree/inventree)\n* Email us at [security@inventree.org](mailto:security@inventree.org)\n",

However, it is a vulnerability that the InvenTree development team takes seriously.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe proposed patch for this vulnerability is prevents injection of un-escaped fields into front-end UI elements.\n\nA future patch will also address sanitization of database fields on the \"back end\", however this will require a much larger effort to refactor multiple database tables.\n\n### Patches\n\n- The issue is addressed in the upcoming `0.8.0` release\n- This fix will also be back-ported to the `0.7.x` branch, applied to the `0.7.2` release\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds for this issue, users should upgrade to a patched version.\n\n### References\n\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/4cae8442-c042-43c2-ad89-6f666eaf3d57/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/9d640ef2-c52c-4106-b043-f7497d577078/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/b114e82f-6c02-485b-82ea-e242f89169c2/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/22783cd3-1b2c-48fc-b31f-03b53c86da0b/\n\nThank you @saharshtapi for bringing this issue to our attention and giving pointers for fixing them.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [github](http://github.com/inventree/inventree)\n* Email us at [security@inventree.org](mailto:security@inventree.org)\n",

However, it is a vulnerability that the InvenTree development team takes seriously.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe proposed patch for this vulnerability is prevents injection of un-escaped fields into front-end UI elements.\n\nA future patch will also address sanitization of database fields on the \"back end\", however this will require a much larger effort to refactor multiple database tables.\n\n### Patches\n\n- The issue is addressed in the upcoming `0.8.0` release\n- This fix will also be back-ported to the `0.7.x` branch, applied to the `0.7.2` release\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds for this issue, users should upgrade to a patched version.\n\n### References\n\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/4cae8442-c042-43c2-ad89-6f666eaf3d57/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/9d640ef2-c52c-4106-b043-f7497d577078/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/b114e82f-6c02-485b-82ea-e242f89169c2/\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/22783cd3-1b2c-48fc-b31f-03b53c86da0b/\n\nThank you @saharshtapi for bringing this issue to our attention and giving pointers for fixing them.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [github](http://github.com/inventree/inventree)\n* Email us at [security@inventree.org](mailto:security@inventree.org)\n",

Each database table is represented as a class object which provides features analogous to the REST CRUD endpoints (Create, Retrieve, Update, Destroy).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe InvenTree python library can be easily installed using PIP:\n\n```\npip install inventree\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nRefer to the [InvenTree documentation](https://inventree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extend/python/)\n",
