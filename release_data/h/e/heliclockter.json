            "description": "Heliclockter\n=======\n\n`heliclockter` is a robust way of dealing with datetimes and timestamps in python. It is statically\ntype checkable as well as runtime enforceable and integrates with [pydantic][pydantic].\n\nThe library exposes 3 classes:\n\n- `datetime_tz`, a datetime ensured to be timezone-aware.\n- `datetime_local`, a datetime ensured to be timezone-aware in the local timezone.\n- `datetime_utc`, a datetime ensured to be timezone-aware in the UTC+0 timezone.\n\nas well as various utilities to instantiate, mutate and serialize those classes.\n\nSee our [announcement post][announcement] for a more background on why we wrote `heliclockter`.\n\n[pydantic]: https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic\n[announcement]: https://www.channable.com/tech/heliclockter-timezone-aware-datetimes-in-python\n\nExamples\n-------\n\nSay you want to create a timestamp of the current time in the UTC+0 timezone.\n\n```python\nfrom heliclockter import datetime_utc\n\nnow = datetime_utc.now()\n# datetime_utc(2022, 11, 4, 15, 28, 10, 478176, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='UTC'))\n```\n\nOr imagine you want to create a timestamp 2 hours in the future from now:\n\n```python\nfrom heliclockter import datetime_utc\n\ntwo_hours_from_now = datetime_utc.future(hours=2)\n# datetime_utc(2022, 11, 4, 17, 28, 52, 478176, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='UTC'))\n```\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Runtime enforcable timezone-aware datetimes\n* Utilities for instantiating, mutating and serializing timezone-aware datetimes\n* Statically type check-ble\n* Pydantic integration\n* Extensive test suite\n* No third party dependencies\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install `heliclockter`, simply: \n\n    $ pip install heliclockter\n\nMore examples\n-------------\n\nImagine you want to parse a JSON response from a third party API which includes a timestamp, and you\nwant to handle the timestamp in the UTC+0 timezone regardless of how the 3rd party relays it. This \ncan easily be done with `pydantic` and `heliclockter`:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom heliclockter import datetime_utc\n\n\nclass ApiResponse(BaseModel):\n    current_time: datetime_utc\n\n\ndef get_response() -> ApiResponse:\n    response = requests.get('https://some-api.com/time')\n    return ApiResponse.parse_obj(response.json())\n```\n\nThe returned `ApiResponse` instance is guaranteed to have parsed the `current_time` attribute \nas UTC+0 no matter how the api provided the timestamp. If no timezone information is provided, \nit will be assumed to be UTC+0.\n\nExpanding the module can be done with little effort, by creating a new class that inherits `datetime_tz`:\n\n```python\nfrom zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\nfrom heliclockter import datetime_tz\n\n\nclass datetime_cet(datetime_tz):\n    \"\"\"\n    A `datetime_cet` is a `datetime_tz` but which is guaranteed to be in the 'CET' timezone.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    assumed_timezone_for_timezone_naive_input = ZoneInfo('CET')\n```\n\nIf you have a timestamp which is naive, *but* the timezone in which it is made is known to you,\nyou can easily create a `datetime_tz` instance using your own defined classes:\n\n```python\naware_dt = datetime_cet.strptime('2022-11-04T15:49:29', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')\n# datetime_cet(2022, 11, 4, 15, 49, 29, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='CET'))\n```\n\nAbout the name\n--------------\n\n`heliclockter` is a word play of \"clock\" and \"helicopter\". The module aims to guide the user and help them make little to no mistakes when handling datetimes, just like a [helicopter parent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent) strictly supervises their children.\n",
