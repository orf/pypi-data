            "description": "depl - deploying should be easy\n===============================\n\n.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/davidhalter/depl.png?branch=master\n    :target: http://travis-ci.org/davidhalter/depl\n    :alt: Travis-CI build status\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/davidhalter/depl/badge.png?branch=master\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/davidhalter/depl\n    :alt: Coverage Status\n\n.. image:: https://pypip.in/d/depl/badge.png\n    :target: https://crate.io/packages/depl/\n    :alt: Number of PyPI downloads\n\n.. image:: https://pypip.in/v/depl/badge.png\n    :target: https://crate.io/packages/depl/\n    :alt: Latest PyPI version\n\n\n``depl`` is a pre-alpha prototype. **We want to start a discussion about how\ndevelopers deploy. How can we improve the current situation?** Please tell us\nwhy you think depl is not the right tool for you! Tell us what you think needs\nto be changed! We hope to make small and medium deployments easy.\n\nDeploying stuff is hard, managing nginx and postgres painful. Why don't we\nsolve that problem? Simple deployments should not involve tweaking\nconfigurations that you have never dealt with before. ``depl`` solves this.\n\nLet's `deploy Django\n<depl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/web-frameworks.html#meteor>`_ to a live\nserver! Create a file called ``depl.yml``::\n    \n    deploy:\n        - django:\n            settings: settings_prod\n            ssl:\n                key: /path/to/key\n                certificate: /path/to/cert\n    hosts:\n        - myhost.com\n\nAnd run ``depl deploy`` in that same directory. After this two step process\nyour website will be running on ``https://myhost.com`` and\n``http://myhost.com``. It only works on Ubuntu servers for now (maybe also\nDebian), but will work on other systems in the future as well.\n\n``depl`` would connect to ``myhost.com`` by SSH, install all necessary software\npackages and initialize your project. In our Django example this would involve\ninstalling ``nginx``, ``uwsgi``, ``postgresql`` (if required by Django's\n``settings.py``). It would install all Python dependencies and run on your\nproduction settings.\n\nCurrently this is also working for `Meteor\n<depl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/web-frameworks.html#meteor>`_ and \n`WSGI <depl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html#testing>`_ (which\nincludes flask).\n\nWhy depl and not ansible, puppet, chef, docker or vagrant?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nHave you ever tried those tools? ansible, puppet and chef are really\ncomplicated to understand. They are made for big deployments, for large scale\noperation engineers. You can read the blog posts below, they explain a bit\nmore. Generally depl solves the use case for all small deployments on your own\nserver, those tools do something different.\n\nDocker and Vagrant are completely different tools. They make controlling VMs\neasy. They do not install your software. However, depl could be used in\ncombination with either of them.\n\nBlog Posts talking about depl\n-----------------------------\n\n- `The current state of deploying Django applications\n  <http://jedidjah.ch/code/2013/12/16/django-deployment/>`_!\n- `Platform as a Service: A Market Analysis\n  <http://jedidjah.ch/code/2013/12/16/paas/>`_!\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nIf you want to know more in general, just read the documentation at\n`<http://depl.rtfd.org>`_!\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nCurrently depl supports Ubuntu/Debian (apt-get), the others:\n\n- Arch Linux (pacman) could be implemented\n- Fedora/CentOS/RHEL (rpm) could be implemented\n- Windows/Apple: Discussions needed (but probably not?!).\n\nDepl is written in Python. Python 3 support will be ready once fabric_ supports\nPython 3.\n\n\nAdditional Ideas\n----------------\n\n- DNS configuration\n- Central logging\n- High Availability tools like HAProxy to make it easy not to go offline for a\n  few seconds while deploying.\n- Could generate e.g. an ansible_ recipe with depl. Possible?\n- Write a \"depl server\" with different backends (e.g. amazon clouds) to\n  automate the process of deploying and increasing servers.\n- Add support for automatic travis testing with depl files. Is that even\n  possible?\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nRead `CONTRIBUTING.md\n<https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ to check\nhow you can contribute! There's also a small developer documentation `available\n<depl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html#testing>`_.\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nUse a virtual machine for testing, please. `Why?\n<depl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html#testing>`_\n\n.. _article: http://jedidjah.ch/code/2013/10/\n.. _ansible: https://github.com/ansible/ansible\n.. _fabric: https://github.com/fabric/fabric",
