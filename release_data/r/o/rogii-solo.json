Set the project you wish to work with by name or UUID.\n\n## Example\n```python\nfrom rogii_solo import SoloClient\n\nsolo_client = SoloClient(client_id='my-client-id', client_secret='my-client-secret')\nsolo_client.set_project_by_name('My project')\n\nproject = solo_client.project\nwells = project.wells\n\nwells_data = wells.to_dict() # List of dicts\nwells_df = wells.to_df() # DataFrame\n```\n\n## Usage\nPlease check the SDK documentation in our [Knowledge Base](https://kb.solo.cloud/Python+SDK).\n",
