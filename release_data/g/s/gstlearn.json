            "description": "## Overview\n\nThe Python *gstlearn* package is a cross-platform Python Package wrapping the [gstlearn C++ Library](https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn). It offers to Python users **all famous Geostatistical methodologies** developped and/or invented by the Geostatistic Team of the [Geosciences Research Center](https://www.geosciences.minesparis.psl.eu/)!<br/>\nCopyright (c) MINES Paristech / PSL University\n\nIf you need to plot *gstlearn* outputs, you can import *gstlearn.plot* module which is based on *matplotlib* (see [modules](https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn/tree/main/python/modules) directory).\n\nSome tutorials (Jupyter Notebooks) are provided in the [demo](https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn/tree/main/python/demo) directory.\n\nSome tests (Python Scripts) are available in the [tests](https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn/tree/main/python/tests) directory.\n  \n## References\n\nThe Python *gstlearn* package is a Python wrapper of the [gstlearn C++ Library](https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn).\n\nThis package contains a copy of [doxy2swig](https://github.com/m7thon/doxy2swig) python script (see LICENSE.doxy2swig in *doc* folder).\n\n## Requirements\n\nFor using this package, the requirements for building *gstlearn C++ library* must be installed:\n\n* See [instructions here](https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn)\n  \nThe following tools must be also available (See [required tools installation](#required-tools-installation) instructions below):\n\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) 3 or higher with *pip*, *numpy*, *pypandoc*, *pybind11* and *matplotlib* modules installed\n* [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/download.html) 4 or higher\n\nNote:\n\n* In all commands below, users must use the correct `python` command (python command prompt) (can be `python3`, `python` or something else depending on your configuration)\n  \n## Installation\n\n### GCC, Clang, MinGW, ...\n\n    cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n    cmake --build build --target python_doc\n    cmake --build build --target python_install\n\nor for those who prefer a single command line\n\n    make python_doc & make python_install\n\nNote:\n\n* The Python package documentation (python_doc target) is optional\n* Using MingGW on a Windows where Visual Studio is also installed may need to add `-G \"MSYS Makefiles\"` in the first command.\n  \n### Microsoft Visual Studio, XCode, ...\n\n    cmake -Bbuild -H.\n    cmake --build build --target python_doc --config Release\n    cmake --build build --target python_install --config Release\n\nNote:\n\n* The Python package documentation (python_doc target) is optional\n* Using Visual Studio on a Windows where MingGW is also installed may need to add `-G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\"` in the first command (adapt version).\n  \n### Important Notes\n\nNotes:\n\n* If you want to build and install the *Debug* version, you must replace `Release` by `Debug` above\n* You may need to precise the location of Boost or HDF5 installation directory (which contain *include* and *lib* folders). In that case, add the following in the first command above:\n  * `-DBoost_ROOT=<path/to/boost>`\n  * `-DHDF5_ROOT=<path/to/hdf5>`\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply import the package and its plot module, then enjoy:\n\n    # Import packages\n    import numpy as np\n    import gstlearn as gl\n    import gstlearn.plot as gp\n    # Grid size\n    nx = 60\n    ny = 30\n    mygrid = gl.DbGrid.create([nx,ny],[1,1])\n    # Add a gaussian random field\n    var = np.random.randn(nx * ny)\n    mygrid.addColumns(var, \"var1\")\n    # Display the field\n    gp.grid(mygrid, title=\"Gaussian random field\", end_plot = True)\n\n## Changelog\n\nPlease, look at [CHANGES file](https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn/blob/main/CHANGES).\n\n## Required tools installation\n\nThis package has been successfully tested with Ubuntu 16/18/20 LTS and Windows 10 (MacOS: not tested)\n\n### Linux (Ubuntu):\n\nExecute the following commands:\n\n    sudo apt install python3\n    sudo apt install python3-pip\n    sudo apt install swig\n    python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade\n    python3 -m pip install pybind11 numpy matplotlib\n\nNotes:\n\n* If your Linux distribution repository doesn't provide minimum required versions, please install the tools manually (see provider website)\n\n### MacOS:\n\nExecute the following commands (Not tested):\n\n    brew install python3\n    brew install swig\n    python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade\n    python3 -m pip install pybind11 numpy matplotlib\n\nNotes:\n\n* If your MacOS distribution repository doesn't provide minimum required versions, please install the tools manually (see provider website)\n\n### Windows:\n\nDownload and install the following tools:\n\n* Python 3+ [from here](https://www.python.org/downloads) (which comes with pip and which is installed in *C:\\\\Python39* for example)\n* SWIG 4+ [from here](http://www.swig.org/download.html) (extract the archive in a directory of yours, let's say *C:\\\\swigwin-4.0.2*, see Notes below)\n* Pybind11, numpy and matplolib python modules by running following instructions in a command prompt:\n\n    python -m pip install pybind11[global] numpy matplotlib\n  \nNotes:\n\n* The *Path* environment variable must be updated to make *swig.exe* (and *python.exe*) available in the batch command line (follow [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho) to add *C:\\\\swigwin-4.0.2* and *C:\\\\Python39* folder in the *Path* variable and restart Windows)\n* The Windows C++ Compiler used must be the same that the one used for compiling Python (Visual C++). Using another compiler than Visual C++ is not supported.\n\n## Remove installed package\n\nTo uninstall the Python Package, execute following command:\n\n    python3 -m pip uninstall gstlearn\n\nNote : You may need to directly modify your site-packages folder by:\n\n* Removing the reference to the old gstlearn package version (see [this topic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43177200/assertionerror-egg-link-does-not-match-installed-location-of-reviewboard-at))\n* Removing a line which contains gstlearn in the ./easy-install.pth file of the site-packages folder\n* Removing all directories starting with *'~stlearn* from the site-packages folder\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe classes and functions documentation is provided with the gstlearn package as html files generated by doxygen. Please refer to gstlearn [README file](https://github.com/gstlearn/gstlearn) for more details. This documentation is also available using the `help` python command (if generated).\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n2022 Team gstlearn\n\n\n",
