If it is greater 260 characters then enable [Long Paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation) or choose other shorter location.\n\nDon't have pip installed? Try installing it, by running this from the command\nline:\n\n    $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGetting started with the Jestor API couldn't be easier. Create a\n`Jestor` instance and you're ready to go.\n\n```python\nfrom jestor.Jestor import Jestor\n\njestor_client = Jestor('<api token>', '<account>')\n\nresult = jestor_client.table('sample_tab').get(limit=3) # result will be a python array with values\n```\n",
