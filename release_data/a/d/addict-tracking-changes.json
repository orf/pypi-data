            "description": "# [addict-tracking-changes](https://github.com/Monallabs-org/addict-tracking-changes)\n\n## Introduction\n\nOriginally, this repository was a fork of [addict](https://github.com/mewwts/addict) by Mats Julian Olsen.\nOvertime, it has substatially diverged in functionality and codebase that it seemed to make\nsense to breakout as its own repository. \n\nThe original addict:  provides an alternative and succient interface to manipulate a dictionary. This is especially\nuseful when dealing with heavily nested dictionaries. As example (taken from https://github.com/mewwts/addict)\na dictionary created using standard python dictionary interface looks as follows:\n```python\nbody = {\n    'query': {\n        'filtered': {\n            'query': {\n                'match': {'description': 'addictive'}\n            },\n            'filter': {\n                'term': {'created_by': 'Mats'}\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}`\n\n``` \ncan be summarized to following three lines:\n\n```python\nbody = Dict()\nbody.query.filtered.query.match.description = 'addictive'\nbody.query.filtered.filter.term.created_by = 'Mats'\n```\n\nThis repo builds on original addict and adds contraptions to track key additions in the dictionary.\nThis features comes in quite handy in building reactive webapps where one has to respond \nto all the changes made on the browser. Addict-tracking-changes is the underpinning\ndata-structure in [ofjustpy](https://github.com/Monallabs-org/ofjustpy): a python based webframework build from [justpy](https://github.com/justpy-org/justpy)\n \nThe functions relevant to tracking changed history are:\n`get_changed_history` and `clear_changed_history`. \nThe `get_changed_history` returns an iterator of XPath style paths like `/a/b/c/e` (see [Demo example](#demo-example)). \n\n## Usage and examples\n\n### Installation\nThis project is not on PyPI. Its a simple package with no third party dependency. \nSimply clone from github and include the source directory in your PYTHONPATH. \n\n### Demo example\n\n```python\nfrom addict import Dict\nbody = Dict()\nbody.query.filtered.query.match.description = 'addictive'\nbody.query.filtered.filter.term.created_by = 'Mats'\n\nfor changed_path in body.get_changed_history():\n    #<work with changed_path>\n\nbody.clear_changed_history()\n```\n\n### Behaviour when values are instances of container types \naddict works as expected when the values of keys are simple data types (such as string, int, float, etc.). However, for container types such as dict, list, tuples, etc. the behaviour \nis somewhat differs. \n\n* dicts \nare treated as opaque object just like simple data types\n\n```python\nfrom addict import Dict\n\nmydict = Dict()\nmydict.a.b.c = {'kk': 1}\nmydict.a.b.e = {'dd': 1}\n\nfor _ in mydict.get_changed_history():\n    print(_) \n```\nwill print\n```\n/a/b/c\n/a/b/e\n```\nand not \n```\n/a/b/cc/kk\n/a/b/e/dd\n```\n\n* lists\nare seen as container, i.e., `get_changed_history` will report path for each element of\nthe list \n\n```python\nfrom addict import Dict\n\nmydict = Dict()\n\nmydict.a.b = [1, [1]]\nmydict.a.c = [2, [2, [3]]]\n```\nget_changed_history will report following paths:\n```\n/a/b/0,\n/a/b/1/0,\n/a/c/0,\n/a/c/1/0,\n/a/c/1/1/\"\n```\n\n* tuple \ntuple  behave same as dict\n\n* sets\nsets behave same as dict\n\n\n\n## Known bugs and Caveats\n1. Only tracks  field additions.  Deletions and updates are not tracked. \n2. freeze doesn't guards against deletions\n3. building dict from another dict as shown in following expression wont' work\n```python\ncjs_cfg = Dict(x, track_changes=True)\n```\ninstead use\n```python \ncjs_cfg = Dict(track_changes = True)\nwith open(\"cjs_cfg.pickle\", \"rb\") as fh:\n    x = pickle.load(fh)\nfor _ in oj.dictWalker(x):\n    oj.dnew(cjs_cfg, _[0], _[1])\n\n```\n\n### EndNotes\n- Docs (in readthedocs format): https://monallabs-org.github.io/addict-tracking-changes/#introduction\n\n- Developed By: webworks.monallabs.in\n\n",
