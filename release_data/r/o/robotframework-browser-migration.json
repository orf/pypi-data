Please update!\n\n|\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\nThis small script analyzes your output.xml and creates a statistic over the usage of your\nSeleniumLibrary Keywords.\n\nIt will check which Selenium Keywords are used, and how often they are called in general.\nIt also check how many different parents (Keywords, TestCases or TestSuites) calls this keyword\ndirectly. This \"parent\" count is the number of places you may have to change when migrating later.\n\nWe never ever ever take any of your private or confidential data!\nWe also just uses hashes of the names of your\nTests and Keywords to sum up their appearance.\nAnd also these hashes are never ever stored in any file.\n\nThe generated data/statistic are absolutely anonymous!\n\nYou will see all collected data as a statistics table when finished.\n\nLike here:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    +----------------------------------+-------+---------+\n    | Keyword                          | count | parents |\n    +----------------------------------+-------+---------+\n    | Checkbox Should Be Selected      | 10    | 2       |\n    | Checkbox Should Not Be Selected  | 10    | 2       |\n    | Clear Element Text               | 1     | 1       |\n    | Click Button                     | 4     | 4       |\n    | Click Element                    | 48    | 20      |\n    | Click Link                       | 18    | 10      |\n    | Close All Browsers               | 30    | 16      |\n    | Close Browser                    | 15    | 8       |\n    | Element Text Should Be           | 18    | 5       |\n    | Execute Javascript               | 18    | 2       |\n    | Get Element Count                | 8     | 1       |\n    | Get Location                     | 8     | 2       |\n    | Get Text                         | 40    | 9       |\n    | Get WebElement                   | 17    | 3       |\n    | Get WebElements                  | 10    | 3       |\n    | Go To                            | 30    | 19      |\n    | Input Password                   | 45    | 19      |\n    | Input Text                       | 47    | 21      |\n    | Location Should Be               | 47    | 16      |\n    | Open Browser                     | 55    | 29      |\n    | Page Should Contain Element      | 9     | 8       |\n    | Select Checkbox                  | 10    | 4       |\n    | Select From List By Label        | 2     | 2       |\n    | Select From List By Value        | 1     | 1       |\n    | Set Window Position              | 2     | 2       |\n    | Switch Window                    | 16    | 1       |\n    | Title Should Be                  | 30    | 16      |\n    | Unselect Checkbox                | 8     | 4       |\n    | Wait Until Element Is Visible    | 27    | 9       |\n    | Wait Until Page Contains Element | 4     | 1       |\n    +----------------------------------+-------+---------+\n\n    Statistics File: /Source/robotframework-browser-migration/src/keyword_stats.json\n    Please upload the file to https://data.keyword-driven.de/index.php/s/SeleniumStats for full anonymity.\n    IP-Addresses or other personal data are not logged when uploading the file!\n    You can also mail it to mailto:rene@robotframework.org.\n\n    Thanks you very much for your support!\n    Your Browser-Team (Mikko, Tatu, Kerkko, Janne and Ren\u00e9)\n\nThe easiest and most anonymous way to share these data with us, would be to upload the\n``keyword_stats.json`` to https://data.keyword-driven.de/index.php/s/SeleniumStats .\nWe do not store any information of the one who uploaded it.
