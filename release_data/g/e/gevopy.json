All dataclass attributes are accepted in \naddition to an special type `Chromosome` provided in the module `genetics`.\nTo start use the already defined chromosome subclasses such `Haploid` and\n`Diploid` depending on the complexity of your genetic model.\n```py\nfrom gevopy import genetics, random\n\nclass Genotype(genetics.GenotypeModel):\n    chromosome_1: genetics.Haploid = Field(default_factory=lambda: random.haploid(12))\n    chromosome_2: genetics.Haploid = Field(default_factory=lambda: random.haploid(10))\n    simple_attribute: float = 1.0\n\nphenotypes = [Genotype() for _ in range(20)]\n```\n> Note Genotype attrubutes *id*, *experiment*, *created*, *parents*,\n*generation*, *score* and *clone* are attributes used by the library.\nOverwriting of this attributes might lead to unexpected behaviors.\n\n### Fitness\nCreate your fitness using the parent class `fitness.FitnessModel` and defining\nthe class method `score`. The fitness to use on the experiment will be an \ninstance of the defined class. You can use the init arguments `cache` and\n`parallel` to optimize how the evaluation flow is executed.\n\n```py\nfrom genopy import fitness\n\nclass MyFitness1(fitness.FitnessModel):\n    def score(self, phenotype):\n        return phenotype.chromosome.count(1)\n\nfx = MyFitness1(cache=True, parallel=True)\n```\n> You can additionally define `setUp` as method to execute once at the begining\nof each generation before phenotypes are evaluated.\n\n### Algorithm\nThe algorithm is the core of your experiment. It defines the rules of the\nevolution process. You can create your own algorithm or use the already\nexisting templates. Algorithms are generally composed by 4 components:\n - **Selection**: Callable which provides the first list of candidates.\n - **Mating**: Callable which provides the second list of candidates.\n - **Crossover**: Callable to generate offspring from candidates.\n - **Mutation**: Callable to mutate phenotype's chromosomes.\n\nAdditionally, each algorithm template might contain additional arguments such a\n`survival_rate` or `similarity`. Make sure you read and understand each of the \narguments and steps.\n\n```py\nfrom gevopy.tools import crossover, mutation, selection\nfrom gevopy import algorithms\n\nmy_algorithm=algorithms.Survival(\n    selection=selection.Tournaments(tournsize=3),\n    mating=selection.Best(),\n    crossover=crossover.TwoPoint(indpb=0.8),\n    mutation=mutation.SinglePoint(indpb=0.5, mutpb=0.2),\n    survival_rate=0.40,\n)\n```\n> The modules `tools.crossover`, `tools.mutation` and `tools.selection` contain\ntemplates and utilities to simplify your algorithm definition.\n\n### Experiment\nThe experiment is the final expression of your evolutionary algorithm.\nit provides the methods to evolve and store phenotypes. Once an experiment\nis instantiated, use the method `run` to force the evolution of the population\nuntil a desired state.\n\nThe results of the experiment can be collected from the method output, calling\n`best` method or adding a [Neo4j]() connection as `database` input when\ninstantiating the experiment to store all phenotypes during the execution.\n\n```py\nimport gevopy\n\nexperiment = gevopy.SimpleEvolution(\n    population=[Genotype() for _ in range(20)],\n    fitness=MyFitness1(cache=True, parallel=True),\n)\n\nexperiment.run(\n    algorithm=my_algorithm,\n    max_generations=20,\n    max_score=12.0,\n)\n\nbest_phenotype = experiment.best()\n```\n>The method `run` forces the evolution of the experiment which is updated on\neach cycle. After the method is completed, you can force again te evolution\nprocess using higher inputs for `max_generations` or `max_score`.\n\n\n## Development\nFork the repository, pick one of the issues at the [issues](https://github.com/BorjaEst/gevopy/issues)\nand create a [Pull request](https://github.com/BorjaEst/gevopy/pulls).\n\n\n## FAQ and Notes\n\n### Why Graph Database?\nStoring relationships at the record level makes sense in genotype \nrelationships as it provides index-free adjacency.\nGraph traversal operations such 'genealogy tree' or certain matches can\nbe performed with no index lookups leading to much better performance.\n",
