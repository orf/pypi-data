With Prism, users can break down their project into modular tasks, manage dependencies, and execute complex computations in sequence.\n\nHere are some of Prism's main features:\n- **Modules as tasks**: Unlike other orchestration platforms, Prism allows tasks to live within their own modules. This not only helps with readability and QC, but also enables users to build powerful, complex pipelines that scale alongside their project.\n- **Real-time dependency declaration**: With Prism, analysts can declare dependencies using a simple function call. No need to explicitly keep track of the pipeline order \u2014 at runtime, Prism automatically parses the function calls and builds the dependency graph.\n- **Flexible CLI**: Analysts can instantiate, compile, and run projects using a simple command-line interface.\n- **Integrations**: Prism integrates with several tools that are popular in the data community, including dbt, Snowflake, PySpark and Google BigQuery. We're adding more integrations every day, so let us know what you'd like to see!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPrism can be installed via ```pip```. Prism requires Python >= 3.7.\n\n```\npip install prism-ds\n```\n\nTo get started with Prism projects, check out our [documentation](https://docs.runprism.com). Some sections of interest include:\n\n- :key: [Fundamentals](https://docs.runprism.com/fundamentals)\n- :seedling: [CLI](https://docs.runprism.com/cli)\n- :electric_plug: [Integrations](https://docs.runprism.com/integrations)\n- :bulb: [Use Cases](https://docs.runprism.com/use-cases)\n\nIn addition, check out some [example projects](https://github.com/mtrivedi50/prism_examples).\n\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nWe're always looking to improve our product. Here's what we're working on at the moment:\n\n- **DAG visualizer**: a clean UI for visualizing the data flow between tasks\n- **Python API**: an API that packages projects into a single class that can be called in other programs\n- **Additional adapters**: Postgres, Redshift, and more!\n- **Cloud deployment**: deploying projects on Amazon EMR clusters, Docker containers, Databricks clusters, and more!\n\nLet us know if you'd like to see another feature!\n",
