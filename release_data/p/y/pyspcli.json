Command Line Interface\nThis CLI tool is to query the Silverpeal/Aruba SD-WAN orchestrator and output the information in your terminal.\n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\nRequierements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n* Python >=3.7\n* User with API KEY\n\nTo get started, install the CLI tool from Pypi ::\n\n    pip3 install pyspcli\n\n\nor download it directly from github::\n\n    pip3 install git+https://github.com/NetDevLazg/spcli.git\n\nOnce the installation is successful, you will need to create a file with your api credentials.\n\n* Create a folder in the following directory `mkdir ~/.spcli`\n* Create a yml file with your credentials in `.spcli` directory\n* Using `vim` \n   * `vim ~/.spcli/creds.yml`\n* Using `nano`\n   * `nano ~/.spcli/creds.yml`\n\nThe yml file needs to have the following variables.\nExample::\n\n    url: silverpeak-orch-use1.silverpeak.cloud\n    token: a38b3360bb4d06fed7e53f77c8752d74bb4faeb4295385a25e02ebc2594d9074a16bb115fce4d4dc9826d824950504b6d23373\n\n\nAfter the file is created and saved, please verify the cli tool version using the following command::\n\n    sp -v\n    version...installed: 0.0.6\n\n\nPossible Errors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIf you receive an error saying \"Command not found\" make sure to add the location where the package is installed to your $PATH\n\nPossible error::\n\n    WARNING: The script sp is installed in '/Users/John/Library/Python/3.8/bin' which is not on PATH.\n\n\nFix::\n\n    export PATH='$PATH:/Users/John/Library/Python/3.8/bin'\n\n\nHelp Function\n---------------\n\nTo check possible commands, use the `-h` flag after a command. for example::\n\n    sp -h\n    usage: sp [-h] [-d] [-v] {orch,appliance,bgp} ...\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      -d, --debug           debug the cli\n      -v, --version         shows cli tool version\n    \n    Silvperpeak Commands:\n      {orch,appliance,bgp,flows}\n        orch                orchesrator commands\n        appliance           edge connect appliance
