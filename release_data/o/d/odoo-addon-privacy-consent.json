Example command to boot Odoo::\n\n    odoo-bin --load=web,privacy_consent\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nNew options for data processing activities:\n\n#. Go to *Privacy > Master Data > Activities* and create one.\n\n#. Give it a name, such as *Sending mass mailings to customers*.\n\n#. Go to tab *Consent* and choose one option in *Ask subjects for consent*:\n\n   * *Manual* tells the activity that you will want to create and send the\n     consent requests manually, and only provides some helpers for you to\n     be able to batch-generate them.\n\n   * *Automatic* enables this module's full power: send all consent requests\n     to selected partners automatically, every day and under your demand.\n\n#. When you do this, all the consent-related options appear. Configure them:\n\n   * A smart button tells you how many consents have been generated, and lets you\n     access them.\n\n   * Choose one *Email template* to send to subjects. This email itself is what\n     asks for consent, and it gets recorded, to serve as a proof that it was sent.\n     The module provides a default template that should be good for most usage\n     cases; and if you create one directly from that field, some good defaults\n     are provided for your comfortability.\n\n   * *Subjects filter* defines what partners will be elegible for inclusion in\n     this data processing activity.\n\n   * You can enable *Accepted by default* if you want to assume subjects\n     accepted their data processing. You should possibly consult your\n     lawyer to use this.\n\n   * You can choose a *Server action* (developer mode only) that will\n     be executed whenever a new non-draft consent request is created,\n     or when its acceptance status changes.\n\n     This module supplies a server action by default, called\n     *Update partner's opt out*, that syncs the acceptance status with the\n     partner's *Elegible for mass mailings* option.\n\n#. Click on *Generate consent requests* link to create new consent requests.\n\n   * If you chose *Manual* mode, all missing consent request are created as\n     drafts, and nothing else is done now.\n\n   * If you chose *Automatic* mode, also those request e-mails are enqueued\n     and, when the mail queue is cleared, they will be set as *Sent*.\n\n#. You will be presented with the list of just-created consent requests.\n   See below.\n\nNew options for consent requests:\n\n#. Access the consent requests by either:\n\n   * Generating new consent requests from a data processing activity.\n\n   * Pressing the *Consents* smart button in a data processing activity.\n\n   * Going to *Privacy > Privacy > Consents*.\n\n#. A consent will include the partner, the activity, the acceptance status,\n   and the request state.\n\n#. You can manually ask for consent by pressing the button labeled as\n   *Ask for consent*.\n\n#. All consent requests and responses are recorded in the mail thread below.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/data-protection/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/data-protection/issues/new?body=module:%20privacy_consent%0Aversion:%2016.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n* initOS GmbH\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n  * Jairo Llopis\n\n* `initOS GmbH <https://www.initos.com>`_:\n\n  * Florian Kantelberg\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/data-protection <https://github.com/OCA/data-protection/tree/16.0/privacy_consent>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
