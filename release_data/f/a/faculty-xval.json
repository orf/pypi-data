            "description": "\n# faculty-xval\nCross validation of machine-learning models on Faculty platform. At present, the package mostly offers a way to cross validate models in parallel by means of Faculty jobs. To access the functionality one makes use of the class:\n\n```python\nfaculty_xval.validation.JobsCrossValidator\n```\nAdditional information is found in the notebooks of the `examples` directory.\n\nThe package supports `keras` and `sklearn` models. Whilst one can write custom models that are compatible with `faculty-xval`, no guarantee is given that the package handles these situations correctly, in particular because of issues concerning the randomisation of weights.\n\nTwo sets of installation instructions are provided below:\n* If you would like to simply use `faculty-xval`, please follow the `User installation instructions`.\n* If you would like to develop `faculty-xval` further, please follow the `Developer installation instructions`.\n\n## User installation instructions\n\n##### Create an environment\nIn your project on Faculty platform, create an environment named `faculty_xval`. In the `PYTHON` section, select `Python 3` and `pip` from the dropdown menus. Then, type `faculty-xval` in the text box, and click on the `ADD` button.\n\nThe environment installs the package `faculty-xval`, and should be applied on every server that you create; this includes both 'normal' interactive servers and job servers, as explained next.\n\n##### Create a job definition\nCreate a new job definition named `cross_validation`. In the `COMMAND` section, paste the following:\n\n`faculty_xval_jobs_xval $in_paths`\n\nThen, add a `PARAMETER` with the name `in_paths`, and ensure that the `Make field mandatory` box is checked.\n\nFinally, under `SERVER SETTINGS`, add `faculty_xval` to the `ENVIRONMENTS` section.\n\nFor cross-validation jobs that are computationally intensive, we recommend using dedicated servers as opposed to running in the cluster. To achieve this, click on `Large and GPU servers` under `SERVER RESOURCES`, and select an appropriate server type from the dropdown menu.\n\nRemember to click `SAVE` when you are finished.\n\n## Developer installation instructions\n\n##### Select a username\nBefore beginning the installation process, pick an appropriate username, such as `foo`. This does not necessarily need to match your Faculty platform username. In the following instructions, your selected username will be referred to as `{USER_NAME}`.\n\n##### Clone the repository\nCreate the folder `/project/{USER_NAME}`. Then, run the commands:\n\n```bash\ncd /project/{USER_NAME}\ngit clone https://github.com/facultyai/faculty-xval.git\n```\n\n##### Create an environment\nNext, create an environment in your project named `faculty_xval_{USER_NAME}`.\n\nIn this environment, under `SCRIPTS`, paste in the following code to the `BASH` section, remembering to change the `USER_NAME` definition on the second line to your selected `{USER_NAME}`:\n\n```bash\n# Remember to change username!\nUSER_NAME={USER_NAME}\n\n# Install faculty-xval from local repository.\npip install /project/$USER_NAME/faculty-xval/\n\n# Turn USER_NAME into an environment variable.\necho \"export USER_NAME=$USER_NAME\" > /etc/faculty_environment.d/app.sh\nif [[ -d /etc/service/jupyter ]] ; then \n  sudo sv restart jupyter\nfi\n```\n\nThis environment should be applied on every server that you create; this includes both 'normal' interactive servers and job servers, as explained next.\n\n##### Create a job definition\nNext, create a new job definition named `cross_validation_{USER_NAME}`. In the `COMMAND` section, paste the following:\n\n`faculty_xval_jobs_xval $in_paths`\n\nThen, add a `PARAMETER` with the name `in_paths`, and ensure that the `Make field mandatory` box is checked.\n\nFinally, under `SERVER SETTINGS`, add `faculty_xval_{USER_NAME}` to the `ENVIRONMENTS` section.\n\nFor cross-validation jobs that are computationally intensive, we recommend using dedicated servers as opposed to running in the cluster. To achieve this, click on `Large and GPU servers` under `SERVER RESOURCES`, and select an appropriate server type from the dropdown menu.\n\nRemember to click `SAVE` when you are finished.\n\n## Try out the examples\nExamples of cross validation with `faculty-xval` for the different types of model are provided in the directories `examples/keras` and `examples/sklearn`. Usage instructions are then divided in two notebooks:\n\n* `jobs_cross_validator_run.ipynb` loads the data, instantiates the model, and starts a Faculty job that carries out the cross validation.\n* `jobs_cross_validator_analyse.ipynb` gathers the results from the cross validation, reloads the target data, and calculates the model accuracy over multiple train-test splits.\n\nNote that the example notebooks must be run in the order just defined.\n\n\n",
