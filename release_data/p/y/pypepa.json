Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License.

            "description": "pyPEPA\n======\n\npyPEPA is a PEPA library and a toolset for [Performance Evaluation Process Algebra](http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa/) (PEPA) by Jane\nHillston. pyPEPA is not a fully PEPA compatible tool, it supports a limited (for now) PEPA syntax (we only allow `<>` operator in system equation), i.e. it does not suport hiding operator (e.g. `P\\{a,b,}` ), does not support rates as mathematical expressions (`r= 2*x+y`), does not calculate utilization or passage time. pyPEPA also does not use Kronecker state space representation and Hillston's aggregation algorithms, so it can have worse performance than the PEPA Eclipse Plugin.\nAll these features, plus more, are planned to be added in next versions. Currently I am working on pyPEPA by myself only but if you are willing to help, just send an email to me or put a pull request. \n\n**Warning: pyPEPA is under development, this is a beta software**\n\n\npyPEPA consist of three parts:\n\n 1. libpepa - a library written in python (mostly 3.3+ conformant)\n 2. pyPEPA - a command line tool for solving and graphing\n 3. distr/ - map reduce tools for solving large PEPA experiments\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n### Package\n\n1. Clone the project\n\n    `git clone git@github.com:tdi/pyPEPA.git pypepa`\n    \n    `cd pypepa`\n\n2. Run install\n\n    `python setup.py install` \n\n\n### Virtualenv and pip\n\nFor the current version I recommend installing in a virtualenv. \n\n1. Clone the project\n\n    `git clone git@github.com:tdi/pyPEPA.git pypepa`\n    \n    `cd pypepa`\n\n2. Make a virtualenv\n\n    `mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 pypepa`\n    \n    `workon pypepa`\n\n3. Install all requirements\n\n    `pip install pyparsing colorama numpy scipy matplotlib`\n\n\npypepa\n======\n\n### Basic arguments\n\nShow help command:\n\n     pypepa -h\n\nSet logging level (the default is NONE):\n\n    pypepa --log {DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, NONE}\n   \n### Calculations\n\n\nCalculate steady state for bank scenario. The putput is by default directed to your terminal. \n\n    pypepa -st models/bankscenario.pepa\n    \n    Statespace of models/bankscenario.pepa.1 has 7 states \n    \n    Steady state vector\n    Using ; delimiter\n    1;Idle,WaitingForCustomer,WaitingForEmployee;0.08333333333333337\n    2;Informed,WaitingForCustomer,WaitingForEmployee;0.25\n    3;WaitingBankResponse,RequestReceived,WaitingForEmployee;0.16666666666666666\n    4;WaitingBankResponse,CustomerNotReliable,WaitingForEmployee;0.16666666666666666\n    5;WaitingBankResponse,CustomerReliable,WaitingForEmployee;0.16666666666666666\n    6;WaitingBankResponse,WaitingManagerResponse,EvaluatingOffer;0.08333333333333333\n    7;OfferReceived,WaitingForCustomer,WaitingForEmployee;0.08333333333333333\n    \nCalculate actions' throughput:\n\n    pypepa -th models/bankscenario.pepa\n    \n    Statespace of models/bankscenario.pepa.1 has 7 states \n\n    Throuhoutput (successful action completion in one time unit)\n    \n    readInformation                          0.08333333333333337\n    createLoanRequest                              0.25\n    getNotReliableMessage                    0.16666666666666666\n    badOffer                                 0.08333333333333333\n    askManager                               0.16666666666666666\n    reset                                    0.08333333333333333\n    goodOffer                                0.08333333333333333\n    checkReliability                         0.3333333333333333\n    \nYou can calculate transient time proability for some number of time steps:\n\n    pypepa --transient 5 models/bankscenario.pepa\n    \n    Transient analysis from time 0 to 10\n\n    Using ; delimiter\n    1;Idle,WaitingForCustomer,WaitingForEmployee;0.08351202761947342\n    2;Informed,WaitingForCustomer,WaitingForEmployee;0.2500169897974121\n    3;WaitingBankResponse,RequestReceived,WaitingForEmployee;0.16662129023697114\n    4;WaitingBankResponse,CustomerNotReliable,WaitingForEmployee;0.16657721277634494\n    5;WaitingBankResponse,CustomerReliable,WaitingForEmployee;0.16657721277634485\n    6;WaitingBankResponse,WaitingManagerResponse,EvaluatingOffer;0.08328947039778702\n    7;OfferReceived,WaitingForCustomer,WaitingForEmployee;0.08340579639566591\n    \nYou can choose a solver by specifying `--solver|-s {direct, sparse}`. By defalt we use sparse solver with LIL matrix becuase it is faster and in overall matrices generated from PEPA models are sparse. There is also an insignificant difference in results. \n\npypepa allows you to visualize all PEPA components by specifying `-gd` switch. The generated graphiz dot files are by deault saved in `dots` folder in the current directory. You can browse dot files with `xdot`, which you need to install first. \n\n    pypepa -gd bankdots models/bankscenario.pepa\n\n\nFinally pypepa can provide us with a tool for experimentation with rates and actions. \nLet's check how throughtput of `askManager` action changes when `rateReset` changes from 1 to 50 with step 1. The default result of this command will be a matplotlib graph.\nThe format of `-var` is \"vartype:varname:value range specifier:value range value\". The one valid\nvartype for now is `rate`, for value range specifiers you can choose: `range` or `list`. For `range`\nyou need to provide START, STOP, STEP, whereas for `list` a comma separated list of values. \nYou can specify other output options with `-f` argument: graph, console, csv. \n\n\n    pypepa.py -var \"rate:rateReset:range:1,50,1\" -val askManager  models/bankscenario.pepa\n\n![bank example](https://raw.github.com/tdi/pypepa/dev/doc/bankexample.png)\n\n\nInstead of `--range` you can specify `--list ` with a custom comma delimited list of values. \n\n### Formatting\n\nYou can specify formats of `-st`, `-th` and `--varrate` with a `--format` option. \nCurrently we support CSV (although `;` not comma delimited), console (the default) and graph (only\nfor varrate experiments). Additionally you can specify `-o|--output` option with a file argument to\n  specify where to save the CSV. \n\n    pypepa -st models/bankscenario.pepa -f csv -o bank_steady.csv\n\n\n\nTODO\n====\n\n###Functional\n\n 1. Implement rate mathematical expressions with functional rates\n 2. Implement passage time analysis\n 3. Implement hiding operator\n 4. Implement 3d graphs and experiments\n 5. Implement Kronecker state space and aggregation\n 6. Implement generalised communication PEPA [genPEPA][genpepa] by Mirco Tribastone\n 7. Add model manipulation language for reducers\n 8.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
