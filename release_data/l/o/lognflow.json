A log viewer is also availble\nto turn an already logged flow into variables. Obviously it will read the folders \nand map them for you, which is something you could spend hours to do yourself.\nAlso there is the nicest progress bar in the world that you can easily understand\nand work with and implement yourself when you have the time.\n\nLokking at most logging packages online, you see that you need to spend a lot of time\nlearning about them and realizing how they work. Specially when you have to deal\nwith http servers and ... which will be a huge pain when working for companies\nwho have their own HPC. \n\nThis is why lognflow is supposed to be handy and strugt forward.\n\n\n* Free software: GNU General Public License v3\n* Documentation: https://lognflow.readthedocs.io.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Implement log_hist\n* Bring scatter3 from rgflib here\n\nCredits\n^^^^^^^^\n\nThis package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.\n\n.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage\n\n\n=======\nHistory\n=======\n\n0.1.0 (2022-11-16)\n------------------\n\n* First release on PyPI.\n",
