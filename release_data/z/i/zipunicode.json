For different languages, Windows uses different `code page`s\nto encode filename. So, if you create a zip file containing a file named `\u00ea.txt` on Linux and \nextract it on Windows, you may got something like `\u251c\u00ac.txt` or `\uff83\uff6a.txt`. \n\nThe exact filename depends on the `code page` or `language` that Windows is using. \nThe same thing also happens when a zip file was created on Windows,\ncontains non-ascii filename, and then extracted on Linux or on Windows that use different `code page`s.\n\nAll that means if the filename wasn't encoded by `UTF-8` `encoding (or code page)`,\nthen there is no easy way to knows which `encoding` that was used when extracting the file. \n\n## Overview\nYou will use `zipu` to interact with zip file.\n\n```bash\n$ zipu -h\n```\n\n```bash\nusage: zipu [-h] [--extract] [--fix] [--encoding ENCODING]\n            [--password PASSWORD]\n            zipfile [destination]\n\nFix filename encoding error inside a zip file.\n\npositional arguments:\n  zipfile               path to zip file\n  destination           folder path to extract zip file\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --extract, -x         extract the zipfile to specified destination\n  --fix, -f             create a new zip file with UTF-8 file names\n  --encoding ENCODING, -enc ENCODING\n                        zip file used encoding: shift-jis, cp932...\n  --password PASSWORD, -pwd PASSWORD\n                        password to extract zip file\n```\n\nExtracting a zip file is as simple as `zipu -x file.zip`. \nFiles are extracted into the folder that has the same name as `file.zip` without `.zip`\nand stays on the same folder path as `file.zip`. Filename `encoding` is handled automatically.\n\nYou can also ensure your zip file being opened correctly on all computers by `zipu -f file.zip`.\nThis will create a new `file_fixed.zip` contains all file names encoded with `UTF-8`.\n\n## Usage:\n1. View content of the zip file:\n\n   You simply point `zipu` to your zip file's path as follow:\n\n    ```bash\n    zipu path/to/file.zip\n    ```\n\n   This makes `zipu` do the following:\n    * automatically guess the encoding that was used to encode file names\n    * check if the file was password encrypted \n    * give you a default extract destination if you don't provide any\n\n   Then, it will show a summarization of the contents of that zip file, \n   something similar to the following:\n\n       D:\\tmp>zipu 20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8.zip\n\n   ```bash\n     * Detected encoding  :  SHIFT_JIS | Language:Japanese | Confidence:99%\n     * Default destination:  D:\\tmp\n     * Password protected :  False\n    --------------------------- try encoding: SHIFT_JIS ---------------------------\n    20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8/\n    20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8/\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff3f\u30ea\u30ca\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9.txt\n    20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8/\u592a\u967d\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fcver5.txt\n    20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8/\u7d4c\u55b6\u5831\u544a_\u685c\u3061\u3083\u3093.txt\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Add '-enc ENCODING' to see filename shown in encoding ENCODING (mbcs, cp932, shift-jis,...)\n    Add '-x' flag to extract all files to default destination\n   ```\n\n   If there is a root folder inside and it has the same name as the zip file as above example, \n   `default destination` will be the parent folder of the zip file.\n   Otherwise, `default destination` will point to a subdirectory \n   that has the name of the zip file as the following case:\n\n       D:\\tmp>zipu 20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb.zip\n\n   ```bash\n     * Detected encoding  :  SHIFT_JIS | Language:Japanese | Confidence:99%\n     * Default destination:  D:\\tmp\\20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\n     * Password protected :  False\n    --------------------------- try encoding: SHIFT_JIS ---------------------------\n    \u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff3f\u30ea\u30ca\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9.txt\n    \u592a\u967d\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fcver5.txt\n    \u7d4c\u55b6\u5831\u544a_\u685c\u3061\u3083\u3093.txt\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Add '-enc ENCODING' to see filename shown in encoding ENCODING (mbcs, cp932, shift-jis,...)\n    Add '-x' flag to extract all files to default destination\n   ```\n\n2. View content with a specific encoding:\n\n   Encoding auto-detection is not always correct. When the sample is too little\n   and some parts of `A` encoding are in `B` encoding, `B` may be wrongly detected\n   instead of `A`. In such cases, you can specify the encoding which you believe\n   is the correct one with `-enc ENCODING` switch.\n\n       D:\\tmp>zipu 20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb.zip -enc cp932\n\n   ```bash\n     * Default destination:  D:\\tmp\\20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\n     * Password protected :  False\n    --------------------------- try encoding: cp932 ---------------------------\n    \u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff3f\u30ea\u30ca\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9.txt\n    \u592a\u967d\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fcver5.txt\n    \u7d4c\u55b6\u5831\u544a_\u685c\u3061\u3083\u3093.txt\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Add '-enc ENCODING' to see filename shown in encoding ENCODING (mbcs, cp932, shift-jis,...)\n    Add '-x' flag to extract all files to default destination\n   ```\n\n   In case that your specified `ENCODING` is wrong and cannot decode some bytes,\n   these unknown bytes will be replaced by a lot of `\ufffd`.\n\n       D:\\tmp>zipu 20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb.zip -enc ascii\n\n   ```bash\n     * Default destination:  D:\\tmp\\20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\n     * Password protected :  False\n    --------------------------- try encoding: ascii ---------------------------\n    \ufffde\ufffdX\ufffdg\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd|\ufffd[\ufffdg\ufffdQ\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdi\ufffdb\ufffdN\ufffdX\ufffdm\ufffd[\ufffdh.txt\n    \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdz\ufffdo\ufffdb\ufffde\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd[ver5.txt\n    \ufffdo\ufffdc\ufffd\ufffd_\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.txt\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Add '-enc ENCODING' to see filename shown in encoding ENCODING (mbcs, cp932, shift-jis,...)\n    Add '-x' flag to extract all files to default destination\n   ```\n\n   Or those bytes are mapped into completely different characters:\n\n       D:\\tmp>zipu 20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb.zip -enc utf16\n\n   ```bash\n     * Default destination:  D:\\tmp\\20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\n     * Password protected :  False\n    --------------------------- try encoding: utf16 ---------------------------\n    \u6583\u5883\u6783\u8c83\u7c83\u5b81\u6783\u5181\u8a83\u6983\u6283\u4e83\u5883\u6d83\u5b81\u6883\u742e\u7478\n    \ube91\u7a97\u6f83\u6283\u6583\u8a83\u5b81\u6576\u3572\u742e\u7478\n    \u6f8c\u6389\uf195\u908d\u8d5f\u82f7\u82bf\u82e1\u2ef1\u7874\ufffd\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Add '-enc ENCODING' to see filename shown in encoding ENCODING (mbcs, cp932, shift-jis,...)\n    Add '-x' flag to extract all files to default destination\n   ```\n\n   Only when auto-detection failed, it is your responsibility to decide which `ENCODING` is the correct one.\n\n   **Warning**: If your console uses non-full `UTF-8` font as in the case of Windows,\n   some `UTF-8` characters are shown as a dot `\u30fb`. \n   This is not a result of wrong encoding but rather unsupported characters by the font.\n\n3. Extract the zip file:\n\n    Usually, encoding auto-detection works just fine so you can jump right to extraction with <br>\n    `zipu -x path/to/file.zip`. The `-x` argument can be either placed **before or after** the path to the zip file.\n\n        D:\\tmp>zipu 20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8.zip -x\n\n    ```bash\n     * Detected encoding  :  SHIFT_JIS | Language:Japanese | Confidence:99%\n    Extracting: 20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8/\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff3f\u30ea\u30ca\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9.txt\n    Extracting: 20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8/\u592a\u967d\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fcver5.txt\n    Extracting: 20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8/\u7d4c\u55b6\u5831\u544a_\u685c\u3061\u3083\u3093.txt\n    Finished\n   ``` \n\n   As mentioned before, without specifying the `destination`, zip file is extracted to\n   the directory in the same path and has the name of that zip file.<br> \n   In the above example, that would be `D:\\tmp\\20200524_\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8`.\n\n   When extract `destination` is specified, you add it right after the zip file's path as:\n\n       zipu -x path/to/file.zip path/to/extract \n\n   If the output file names are unreadable, \n   you have to guess the `ENCODING` with `-enc` switch as described in **2. View content with a specified encoding**.\n   Then you can use that `ENCODING` to extract zip file:\n\n       zipu path/to/file.zip -x -enc ENCODING\n\n4. A Password protected zip file:\n\n    If a zip file is encrypted, ` * Password protected :  True` will show up when viewing its content. \n    When extracting the zip file, you will be asked for `password` if you haven't provided any.\n    You can also specify password directly in the command as follows:\n\n        zipu path/to/file.zip -x -pwd PASSWORD  \n\n5. Mixed contents:\n\n   Some zip files are very tricky. It contains file names of different encodings. Some `UTF-8`, some not.\n   For `UTF-8` marked files, `zipu` will leave it as is while trying different `ENCODING` on other files.\n   `UTF-8` encoded filename has `(UTF-8) ` string prefixed in the content view:\n\n       D:\\tmp>zipu \u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9.zip\n\n   ```bash\n    * Detected encoding  :  SHIFT_JIS | Language:Japanese | Confidence:63%\n    * Default destination:  D:\\tmp\\\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\n    * Password protected :  False\n   --------------------------- try encoding: SHIFT_JIS ---------------------------\n   (UTF-8) V\u00f9ng Tr\u1eddi B\u00ecnh Y\u00ean.txt\n   \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f.txt\n   \u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\uff3f\u30ea\u30ca\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30c9.txt\n   \u592a\u967d\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fcver5.txt\n   \u7d4c\u55b6\u5831\u544a_\u685c\u3061\u3083\u3093.txt\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Add '-enc ENCODING' to see filename shown in encoding ENCODING (mbcs, cp932, shift-jis,...)\n   Add '-x' flag to extract all files to default destination\n   ```\n\n   When extracting, `UTF-8` encoded filename will not wrongly be decoded with detected `ENCODING` \n   so that you can read it as is. \n\n   **Warning**: `zipu` cannot handle zip file that contains three or more encodings, or two encodings\n   but neither is `UTF-8`. In such cases, you have to extract the zip file for each encoding.\n\n6. Fixing a zip file:\n\n   If you make a zip file contains file names which are not in `UTF-8` nor `ASCII` encoding, \n   then you can ensure that your colleagues who use computers of different language can \n   open the zip just fine as follows:\n\n   ```bash\n   zipu -f path/to/file.zip\n   ```\n\n   This first extracts your zip file (and convert all file names to `UTF-8`). \n   Then it compresses extracted contents and adds `_fixed` suffix to the zip filename.\n   The fixed zip file is on the same path as the original one.\n\n   **Warning**: `zipu` cannot create password encrypted zip file. \n   With these files you have to first extract it by `zipu` and then re-zip it \n   with your conventional tool.\n\n\n",
