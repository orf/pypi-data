Write a `Schedule`.\n\nWant to schedule something for every time there's penumbral lunar eclipse over\nOld Carthage, or the first day of every prime numbered Gregorian year?\nWrite a `TimeSet`.\n\nNeed to trigger something weird? If you can fit it in a python function, it'll\nwork as a `Job`.\n\n### Why did you make this?\n\nI needed it for another project. I started out using `schedule`, but it quickly\nbecame clear that I needed something more flexible and extensible.\n\n### Why not improve `schedule`?\n\nMy particular use cases would have required pretty dramatic changes,\nand looking at the contribution rules (in particular the requirement that it\nwork for python2, and the requirement that it not use external libraries)\nfor `schedule` I decided it was not going to be very plausible.\n\nIn addition, I wanted more flexible fluent building, and native first class\nsupport for jobs that run only once.\n\n### Why not improve `python-crontab`?\n\nThe goals of python-crontab are a little different. I wanted to focus on\nscheduling within python (not just running bash jobs). I wanted to support\nscheduling singleton jobs, as above. And I wanted something more readable.\n\n",
