            "description": "![Continuous integration](https://github.com/alexflint/logical-induction/actions/workflows/integrate.yaml/badge.svg)\n\n# Logical induction in Python\n\nThis repository contains code to support the guide to logical induction for\nsoftware engineers (which has not yet been published). It consists of a\nstraightforward python implementation of the logical induction algorithm\npublished by *Garrabrant et al* in 2018. I have prioritized simplicity over\nefficiency.\n\nTo run the example code:\n```bash\n$ git clone git@github.com:alexflint/logical-induction.git\n$ cd logical-induction\n$ python3 logical_induction_example.py\n\nafter update 1:\n  the sky is blue                          1.000000\n  the sky is blue | the sky is green       0.000000\n\nafter update 2:\n  the sky is green \u2192 the world is round    0.000000\n  the sky is blue                          0.000000\n  the sky is blue | the sky is green       1.000000\n```\n\n### Organization of the code\n\nThe main interface is the `LogicalInductor` class in `inductor.py`:\n\n```python\nclass LogicalInductor(object):\n    ...\n\n    def update(self, observation, trading_algorithm):\n        \"\"\"\n        Given: \n         * An observation\n         * A trading algorithm\n        Return:\n         * A belief state\n        \n        Implements the logical induction algorithm as per 5.4.1 in the paper\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nThe update function takes as input an observation, which is a logical sentence\nthat is to be taken to be true from here on, and a trading algorithm, which is a\nset of formulas specifying trades to be executed that the logical inductor will\nset its credences in order to avoid being exploited by.\n\nThe representation of logical sentences is implemented in `sentence.py` and\nworks as follows. The class `sentence.Atom` represents a claim about the world\nnot further reducible by logical connectives such as AND, OR, NOT. Its\nconstructor takes a string, which can be anything and is only to help humans\nkeep track of what is going on. The other classes in this file implement\nconjunctions, disjunctions, logical negation, and material implication.\n\nThe representation of trading formulas is implemented in `formula.py`. A trading\nformula is a simple language for expressing buy/sell trades that a logical\ninductor must not be exploited by. The classes in this file follow section A.2\nfrom the paper.\n\nThe representation of belief states and histories of is in `credence.py`. A\nbelief state is a map from sentences to credences, and a history of belief\nstates is a list of belief states.\n\nThe code in `enumerator.py` provides various routines for enumerating possible\nworlds.\n\nThe code in `example/two_updates.py` instantiates a logical inductor and\nfeeds it two observations, printing out the credences it receives in response.\n",
