It means\nthat if you reserved a quantity of products which bring the virtual\nstock below the minimum, the orderpoint will be triggered and new\npurchase orders will be generated. It also implies that the max may be\nexceeded if the reservations are canceled.\n\nIf ownership of stock is active in the stock settings, you can specify the\nowner on the reservation.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo make a stock reservation:\n\n#.
