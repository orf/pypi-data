Installation of this extension provides a\nREST API to run, query, stop and delete\nnotebook jobs; the UI provides an interface to create, list and view job\ndetails.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- JupyterLab >= 3.0\n\n## Install\n\nTo install the extension, execute:\n\n```bash\npip install jupyter_scheduler\n```\n\n## Uninstall\n\nTo remove the extension, execute:\n\n```bash\npip uninstall jupyter_scheduler\n```\n\n## Troubleshoot\n\nIf you are seeing the frontend extension, but it is not working, check\nthat the server extension is enabled:\n\n```bash\njupyter server extension list\n```\n\nIf the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing\nthe frontend extension, check the frontend extension is installed:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension list\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development install\n\nNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.\n\nThe `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of\n[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo to your local environment\ngit clone https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter-scheduler.git\n\n# Change dir to the cloned project\ncd jupyter-scheduler\n\n# Install the project in editable mode\npip install -e .\n\n# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n\n# Server extension must be manually installed in develop mode\njupyter server extension enable jupyter_scheduler\n\n# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes\njlpm build\n```\n\nYou can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.\n\n```bash\n# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed\njlpm watch\n# Run JupyterLab in another terminal\njupyter lab\n```\n\nWith the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).\n\nBy default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab build --minimize=False\n```\n\n### Development uninstall\n\n```bash\n# Server extension must be manually disabled in develop mode\njupyter server extension disable jupyter_scheduler\npip uninstall jupyter_scheduler\n```\n\nIn development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`\ncommand. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`\nfolder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `jupyter-scheduler` within that folder.\n\n### Testing the extension\n\n#### Server tests\n\nThis extension is using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for Python code testing.\n\nInstall test dependencies (needed only once):\n\n```sh\npip install -e \".[test]\"\n```\n\nTo execute them, run:\n\n```sh\npytest -vv -r ap --cov jupyter_scheduler\n```\n\n#### Frontend tests\n\nThis extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.\n\nTo execute them, execute:\n\n```sh\njlpm\njlpm test\n```\n\n#### Integration tests\n\nThis extension uses Playwright for the integration tests (aka user level tests).\nMore precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.\n\nMore information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.\n\n### Packaging the extension\n\nSee [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nYou can configure the server extension to replace the Scheduler server API, replace the execution engine, re-create the database tables, and select a database path.\n\n#### drop_tables\n\nSetting this value to `True` will re-create the database tables on each JupyterLab start. This will destroy all existing data. It may be necessary if your database's schema is out of date.\n\n```\njupyter lab --SchedulerApp.drop_tables=True\n```\n\n#### db_url\n\nThe fully qualified URL of the database. For example, a SQLite database path will look like `sqlite:///<database-file-path>`.\n\n```\njupyter lab --SchedulerApp.db_url=sqlite:///<database-file-path>\n```\n\n#### scheduler_class\n\nThe fully classified classname to use for the scheduler API. This class should extend `jupyter_scheduler.scheduler.BaseScheduler` and implement all abstract methods. The default class is `jupyter_scheduler.scheduler.Scheduler`.\n\n```\njupyter lab --SchedulerApp.scheduler_class=jupyter_scheduler.scheduler.Scheduler\n```\n\n#### environment_manager_class\n\nThe fully classified classname to use for the environment manager. This class should extend `jupyter_scheduler.environments.EnvironmentManager` and implement all abstract methods. The default class is `jupyter_scheduler.environments.CondaEnvironmentManager`.\n\n```\njupyter lab --SchedulerApp.environment_manager_class=jupyter_scheduler.environments.CondaEnvironmentManager\n```\n\n#### execution_manager_class\n\nThe fully classified classname to use for the execution manager, the module that is responsible for reading the input file, executing and writing the output. This option lets you specify a custom execution engine without replacing the whole scheduler API. This class should extend `jupyter_scheduler.executors.ExecutionManager` and implement the execute method. The default class is `jupyter_scheduler.executors.DefaultExecutionManager`.\n\n```\n# This can be configured on the BaseScheduler class\njupyter lab --BaseScheduler.execution_manager_class=jupyter_scheduler.executors.DefaultExecutionManager\n\n# Or, on the Scheduler class directly\njupyter lab --Scheduler.execution_manager_class=jupyter_scheduler.executors.DefaultExecutionManager\n```\n",
