However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n\t      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n\t      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n\t      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n\t      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n\t      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\t\r\n\t   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\t\r\n\t   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\t\r\n\t      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n\t      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n\t      replaced with your own identifying information.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n\t      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n\t      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n\t      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n\t      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n\t      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\t\r\n\t   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\t\r\n\t   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\t\r\n\t      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n\t      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n\t      replaced with your own identifying information.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n\t      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n\t      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n\t      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n\t      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n\t      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\t\r\n\t   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\t\r\n\t   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\t\r\n\t      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n\t      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n\t      replaced with your own identifying information.

False positive\nmatches are possible, but false negatives are not.\n\n**Reference**: Bloom, B. H. (1970). Space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors.\nCommunications of the ACM, 13(7), 422-426.\n[Full text article](http://crystal.uta.edu/~mcguigan/cse6350/papers/Bloom.pdf)\n\n### Python\n\nbasic usage\n\n```python\nfrom fastbloom_rs import BloomFilter\n\nbloom = BloomFilter(100_000_000, 0.01)\n\nbloom.add_str('hello')\nbloom.add_bytes(b'world')\nbloom.add_int(9527)\n\nassert bloom.contains('hello')\nassert bloom.contains(b'world')\nassert bloom.contains(9527)\n\nassert not bloom.contains('hello world')\n```\n\nbuild bloom filter from bytes or list\n\n```python\nfrom fastbloom_rs import BloomFilter\n\nbloom = BloomFilter(100_000_000, 0.01)\nbloom.add_str('hello')\nassert bloom.contains('hello')\n\nbloom2 = BloomFilter.from_bytes(bloom.get_bytes(), bloom.hashes())\nassert bloom2.contains('hello')\n\nbloom3 = BloomFilter.from_int_array(bloom.get_int_array(), bloom.hashes())\nassert bloom3.contains('hello')\n\n```\n\nmore examples at [py_tests](py_tests/test_bloom.py).\n\n### Rust\n\n```rust\nuse fastbloom_rs::{BloomFilter, FilterBuilder};\n\nlet mut bloom = FilterBuilder::new(100_000_000, 0.01).build_bloom_filter();\n\nbloom.add(b\"helloworld\");\nassert_eq!(bloom.contains(b\"helloworld\"), true);\nassert_eq!(bloom.contains(b\"helloworld!\"), false);\n```\n\nmore examples at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/fastbloom-rs)\n\n## CountingBloomFilter\n\nA Counting Bloom filter works in a similar manner as a regular Bloom filter; however, it is\nable to keep track of insertions and deletions. In a counting Bloom filter, each entry in the\nBloom filter is a small counter associated with a basic Bloom filter bit.\n\n**Reference**: F. Bonomi, M. Mitzenmacher, R. Panigrahy, S. Singh, and G. Varghese, \u201cAn Improved\nConstruction for Counting Bloom Filters,\u201d in 14th Annual European Symposium on\nAlgorithms, LNCS 4168, 2006\n\n### Python\n\n```python\nfrom fastbloom_rs import CountingBloomFilter\n\ncbf = CountingBloomFilter(1000_000, 0.01)\ncbf.add('hello')\ncbf.add('hello')\nassert 'hello' in cbf\ncbf.remove('hello')\nassert 'hello' in cbf  # because 'hello' added twice. \n# If add same element larger than 15 times, then remove 15 times the filter will not contain the element.\ncbf.remove('hello')\nassert 'hello' not in cbf\n```\n\nA CountingBloomFilter has a four bits counter to save hash index, so when insert an\nelement repeatedly, the counter will spill over quickly. So, you can set\n`enable_repeat_insert` to `False` to check whether the element has added.\nif it has added, it will not add again. `enable_repeat_insert` default set to `True`.\n\n```python\nfrom fastbloom_rs import CountingBloomFilter\n\ncbf = CountingBloomFilter(1000_000, 0.01, False)\ncbf.add('hello')\ncbf.add('hello')  # because enable_repeat_insert=False, this addition will not take effect. \nassert 'hello' in cbf\ncbf.remove('hello')\nassert 'hello' not in cbf \n```\n\nmore examples at [py_tests](py_tests/test_counting_bloom_filter.py).\n\n### Rust\n\n```rust\nuse fastbloom_rs::{CountingBloomFilter, FilterBuilder};\n\nlet mut builder = FilterBuilder::new(100_000, 0.01);\nlet mut cbf = builder.build_counting_bloom_filter();\ncbf.add(b\"helloworld\");\nassert_eq!(bloom.contains(b\"helloworld\"), true);\n```\n\n# benchmark\n\n## computer info\n\n| CPU                                    | Memory | OS         |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|------------|\n| AMD Ryzen 7 5800U with Radeon Graphics | 16G    | Windows 10 |\n\n## add one str to bloom filter\n\nBenchmark insert one str to bloom filter:\n\n```text\nbloom_add_test          time:   [41.168 ns 41.199 ns 41.233 ns]\n                        change: [-0.4891% -0.0259% +0.3417%] (p = 0.91 > 0.05)\n                        No change in performance detected.\nFound 13 outliers among 100 measurements (13.00%)\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\n  12 (12.00%) high severe\n```\n\n## add one million to bloom filter\n\nBenchmark loop insert `(1..1_000_000).map(|n| { n.to_string() })` to bloom filter:\n\n```text\nbloom_add_all_test      time:   [236.24 ms 236.86 ms 237.55 ms]\n                        change: [-3.4346% -2.9050% -2.3524%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\n                        Performance has improved.\nFound 5 outliers among 100 measurements (5.00%)\n  4 (4.00%) high mild\n  1 (1.00%) high severe\n```\n\n## check one contains in bloom filter\n\n```text\nbloom_contains_test     time:   [42.065 ns 42.102 ns 42.156 ns]\n                        change: [-0.7830% -0.5901% -0.4029%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\n                        Change within noise threshold.\nFound 15 outliers among 100 measurements (15.00%)\n  1 (1.00%) low mild\n  5 (5.00%) high mild\n  9 (9.00%) high severe\n```\n\n## check one not contains in bloom filter\n\n```text\nbloom_not_contains_test time:   [22.695 ns 22.727 ns 22.773 ns]\n                        change: [-3.1948% -2.9695% -2.7268%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\n                        Performance has improved.\nFound 12 outliers among 100 measurements (12.00%)\n  4 (4.00%) high mild\n  8 (8.00%) high severe\n```\n\n## add one str to counting bloom filter\n\n```text\ncounting_bloom_add_test time:   [60.822 ns 60.861 ns 60.912 ns]\n                        change: [+0.2427% +0.3772% +0.5579%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)\n                        Change within noise threshold.\nFound 10 outliers among 100 measurements (10.00%)\n  1 (1.00%) low severe\n  4 (4.00%) low mild\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\n  4 (4.00%) high severe\n```\n\n## add one million to counting bloom filter\n\nBenchmark loop insert `(1..1_000_000).map(|n| { n.to_string() })` to counting bloom filter:\n\n```text\ncounting_bloom_add_million_test\n                        time:   [272.48 ms 272.58 ms 272.68 ms]\nFound 2 outliers among 100 measurements (2.00%)\n  1 (1.00%) low mild\n  1 (1.00%) high mild\n```\n",
