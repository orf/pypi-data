We archive off versions, keeping the path intact (until a user changes them).\n\n| Prefix                                  | Intent                 |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| `/workspace/kylek/notebooks/mine.ipynb` | Notebook in \u201cdraft\u201d    |\n| `/published/kylek/notebooks/mine.ipynb` | Current published copy |\n\nScheduled notebooks will also be referred to by the notebook key. In addition, we'll need to be able to surface version IDs as well.\n\n### Transitioning to this Storage Plan\n\nSince most people are on a regular filesystem, we'll start with writing to the\n`/workspace` prefix as Archival Storage (writing on save using a `post_save_hook`\nfor a Jupyter contents manager).\n\n### Publishing\n\nThe bookstore publishing endpoint is a `serverextension` to the classic Jupyter\nserver. This means you will need to explicitly enable the `serverextension`\nto use the endpoint.\n\nTo do so, run:\n\n    jupyter serverextension enable --py bookstore\n\nTo enable it only for the current environment, run:\n\n    jupyter serverextension enable --py bookstore --sys-prefix\n\n## Installation\n\n**bookstore** requires Python 3.6 or higher.\n\nNote: Supports installation on Jupyter servers running Python 3.6 and above.\nYour notebooks can still be run in Python 2 or Python 3.\n\n1. Clone this repo.\n2. At the repo's root, enter in the Terminal: `python3 -m pip install .` (Tip: don't forget the dot at the end of the command)\n\n## Configuration\n\n```python\n# jupyter config\n# At ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py for user installs on macOS\n# See https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/jupyter-directories.html for other places to plop this\n\nfrom bookstore import BookstoreContentsArchiver\n\nc.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = BookstoreContentsArchiver\n\n# All Bookstore settings are centralized on one config object so you don't have to configure it for each class\nc.BookstoreSettings.workspace_prefix = \"/workspace/kylek/notebooks\"\nc.BookstoreSettings.published_prefix = \"/published/kylek/notebooks\"\n\nc.BookstoreSettings.s3_bucket = \"<bucket-name>\"\n\n# Note: if bookstore is used from an EC2 instance with the right IAM role, you don't\n# have to specify these\nc.BookstoreSettings.s3_access_key_id = <AWS Access Key ID / IAM Access Key ID>\nc.BookstoreSettings.s3_secret_access_key = <AWS Secret Access Key / IAM Secret Access Key>\n```\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you are developing on bookstore you will want to run the ci tests locally and to make releases.\n\nUse [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more about contributing.\nUse [running_ci_locally.md](./running_ci_locally.md) to learn more about running ci tests locally.\nUse [running_python_tests.md](./running_python_tests.md) to learn about running tests locally.\nUse [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md) to learn more about releasing bookstore.\n\n\n",
