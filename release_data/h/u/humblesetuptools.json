            "description": "Humblesetuptools is a fork of setuptools that doesn't install to .egg\ndirectories, and doesn't mess with your sys.path. Use this at your own risk.\n\nFor information about setuptools, see `setuptools on PyPI\n<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_.\n\n=======\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n-----\n3.4.4\n-----\n\n* Issue #184: Correct failure where find_package over-matched packages\n  when directory traversal isn't short-circuited.\n\n-----\n3.4.3\n-----\n\n* Issue #183: Really fix test command with Python 3.1.\n\n-----\n3.4.2\n-----\n\n* Issue #183: Fix additional regression in test command on Python 3.1.\n\n-----\n3.4.1\n-----\n\n* Issue #180: Fix regression in test command not caught by py.test-run tests.\n\n---\n3.4\n---\n\n* Issue #176: Add parameter to the test command to support a custom test\n  runner: --test-runner or -r.\n* Issue #177: Now assume most common invocation to install command on\n  platforms/environments without stack support (issuing a warning). Setuptools\n  now installs naturally on IronPython. Behavior on CPython should be\n  unchanged.\n\n---\n3.3\n---\n\n* Add ``include`` parameter to ``setuptools.find_packages()``.\n\n---\n3.2\n---\n\n* Pull Request #39: Add support for C++ targets from Cython ``.pyx`` files.\n* Issue #162: Update dependency on certifi to 1.0.1.\n* Issue #164: Update dependency on wincertstore to 0.2.\n\n---\n3.1\n---\n\n* Issue #161: Restore Features functionality to allow backward compatibility\n  (for Features) until the uses of that functionality is sufficiently removed.\n\n-----\n3.0.2\n-----\n\n* Correct typo in previous bugfix.\n\n-----\n3.0.1\n-----\n\n* Issue #157: Restore support for Python 2.6 in bootstrap script where\n  ``zipfile.ZipFile`` does not yet have support for context managers.\n\n---\n3.0\n---\n\n* Issue #125: Prevent Subversion support from creating a ~/.subversion\n  directory just for checking the presence of a Subversion repository.\n* Issue #12: Namespace packages are now imported lazily.  That is, the mere\n  declaration of a namespace package in an egg on ``sys.path`` no longer\n  causes it to be imported when ``pkg_resources`` is imported.  Note that this\n  change means that all of a namespace package's ``__init__.py`` files must\n  include a ``declare_namespace()`` call in order to ensure that they will be\n  handled properly at runtime.  In 2.x it was possible to get away without\n  including the declaration, but only at the cost of forcing namespace\n  packages to be imported early, which 3.0 no longer does.\n* Issue #148: When building (bdist_egg), setuptools no longer adds\n  ``__init__.py`` files to namespace packages. Any packages that rely on this\n  behavior will need to create ``__init__.py`` files and include the\n  ``declare_namespace()``.\n* Issue #7: Setuptools itself is now distributed as a zip archive in addition to\n  tar archive. ez_setup.py now uses zip archive. This approach avoids the potential\n  security vulnerabilities presented by use of tar archives in ez_setup.py.\n  It also leverages the security features added to ZipFile.extract in Python 2.7.4.\n* Issue #65: Removed deprecated Features functionality.\n* Pull Request #28: Remove backport of ``_bytecode_filenames`` which is\n  available in Python 2.6 and later, but also has better compatibility with\n  Python 3 environments.\n* Issue #156: Fix spelling of __PYVENV_LAUNCHER__ variable.\n\n---\n2.2\n---\n\n* Issue #141: Restored fix for allowing setup_requires dependencies to\n  override installed dependencies during setup.\n* Issue #128: Fixed issue where only the first dependency link was honored\n  in a distribution where multiple dependency links were supplied.\n\n-----\n2.1.2\n-----\n\n* Issue #144: Read long_description using codecs module to avoid errors\n  installing on systems where LANG=C.\n\n-----\n2.1.1\n-----\n\n* Issue #139: Fix regression in re_finder for CVS repos (and maybe Git repos\n  as well).\n\n---\n2.1\n---\n\n* Issue #129: Suppress inspection of ``*.whl`` files when searching for files\n  in a zip-imported file.\n* Issue #131: Fix RuntimeError when constructing an egg fetcher.\n\n-----\n2.0.2\n-----\n\n* Fix NameError during installation with Python implementations (e.g. Jython)\n  not containing parser module.\n* Fix NameError in ``sdist:re_finder``.\n\n-----\n2.0.1\n-----\n\n* Issue #124: Fixed error in list detection in upload_docs.\n\n---\n2.0\n---\n\n* Issue #121: Exempt lib2to3 pickled grammars from DirectorySandbox.\n* Issue #41: Dropped support for Python 2.4 and Python 2.5. Clients requiring\n  setuptools for those versions of Python should use setuptools 1.x.\n* Removed ``setuptools.command.easy_install.HAS_USER_SITE``. Clients\n  expecting this boolean variable should use ``site.ENABLE_USER_SITE``\n  instead.\n* Removed ``pkg_resources.ImpWrapper``. Clients that expected this class\n  should use ``pkgutil.ImpImporter`` instead.\n\n-----\n1.4.2\n-----\n\n* Issue #116: Correct TypeError when reading a local package index on Python\n  3.\n\n-----\n1.4.1\n-----\n\n* Issue #114: Use ``sys.getfilesystemencoding`` for decoding config in\n  ``bdist_wininst`` distributions.\n\n* Issue #105 and Issue #113: Establish a more robust technique for\n  determining the terminal encoding::\n\n    1. Try ``getpreferredencoding``\n    2. If that returns US_ASCII or None, try the encoding from\n       ``getdefaultlocale``. If that encoding was a \"fallback\" because Python\n       could not figure it out from the environment or OS, encoding remains\n       unresolved.\n    3. If the encoding is resolved, then make sure Python actually implements\n       the encoding.\n    4. On the event of an error or unknown codec, revert to fallbacks\n       (UTF-8 on Darwin, ASCII on everything else).\n    5. On the encoding is 'mac-roman' on Darwin, use UTF-8 as 'mac-roman' was\n       a bug on older Python releases.\n\n    On a side note, it would seem that the encoding only matters for when SVN\n    does not yet support ``--xml`` and when getting repository and svn version\n    numbers. The ``--xml`` technique should yield UTF-8 according to some\n    messages on the SVN mailing lists. So if the version numbers are always\n    7-bit ASCII clean, it may be best to only support the file parsing methods\n    for legacy SVN releases and support for SVN without the subprocess command\n    would simple go away as support for the older SVNs does.\n\n---\n1.4\n---\n\n* Issue #27: ``easy_install`` will now use credentials from .pypirc if\n  present for connecting to the package index.\n* Pull Request #21: Omit unwanted newlines in ``package_index._encode_auth``\n  when the username/password pair length indicates wrapping.\n\n-----\n1.3.2\n-----\n\n* Issue #99: Fix filename encoding issues in SVN support.\n\n-----\n1.3.1\n-----\n\n* Remove exuberant warning in SVN support when SVN is not used.\n\n---\n1.3\n---\n\n* Address security vulnerability in SSL match_hostname check as reported in\n  Python #17997.\n* Prefer `backports.ssl_match_hostname\n  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.ssl_match_hostname>`_ for backport\n  implementation if present.\n* Correct NameError in ``ssl_support`` module (``socket.error``).\n\n---\n1.2\n---\n\n* Issue #26: Add support for SVN 1.7. Special thanks to Philip Thiem for the\n  contribution.\n* Issue #93: Wheels are now distributed with every release. Note that as\n  reported in Issue #108, as of Pip 1.4, scripts aren't installed properly\n  from wheels. Therefore, if using Pip to install setuptools from a wheel,\n  the ``easy_install`` command will not be available.\n* Setuptools \"natural\" launcher support, introduced in 1.0, is now officially\n  supported.\n\n-----\n1.1.7\n-----\n\n* Fixed behavior of NameError handling in 'script template (dev).py' (script\n  launcher for 'develop' installs).\n* ``ez_setup.py`` now ensures partial downloads are cleaned up following\n  a failed download.\n* Distribute #363 and Issue #55: Skip an sdist test that fails on locales\n  other than UTF-8.\n\n-----\n1.1.6\n-----\n\n* Distribute #349: ``sandbox.execfile`` now opens the target file in binary\n  mode, thus honoring a BOM in the file when compiled.\n\n-----\n1.1.5\n-----\n\n* Issue #69: Second attempt at fix (logic was reversed).\n\n-----\n1.1.4\n-----\n\n* Issue #77: Fix error in upload command (Python 2.4).\n\n-----\n1.1.3\n-----\n\n* Fix NameError in previous patch.\n\n-----\n1.1.2\n-----\n\n* Issue #69: Correct issue where 404 errors are returned for URLs with\n  fragments in them (such as #egg=).\n\n-----\n1.1.1\n-----\n\n* Issue #75: Add ``--insecure`` option to ez_setup.py to accommodate\n  environments where a trusted SSL connection cannot be validated.\n* Issue #76: Fix AttributeError in upload command with Python 2.4.\n\n---\n1.1\n---\n\n* Issue #71 (Distribute #333): EasyInstall now puts less emphasis on the\n  condition when a host is blocked via ``--allow-hosts``.\n* Issue #72: Restored Python 2.4 compatibility in ``ez_setup.py``.\n\n---\n1.0\n---\n\n* Issue #60: On Windows, Setuptools supports deferring to another launcher,\n  such as Vinay Sajip's `pylauncher <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/pylauncher>`_\n  (included with Python 3.3) to launch console and GUI scripts and not install\n  its own launcher executables. This experimental functionality is currently\n  only enabled if  the ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER`` environment variable is set to\n  \"natural\". In the future, this behavior may become default, but only after\n  it has matured and seen substantial adoption. The ``SETUPTOOLS_LAUNCHER``\n  also accepts \"executable\" to force the default behavior of creating launcher\n  executables.\n* Issue #63: Bootstrap script (ez_setup.py) now prefers Powershell, curl, or\n  wget for retrieving the Setuptools tarball for improved security of the\n  install. The script will still fall back to a simple ``urlopen`` on\n  platforms that do not have these tools.\n* Issue #65: Deprecated the ``Features`` functionality.\n* Issue #52: In ``VerifyingHTTPSConn``, handle a tunnelled (proxied)\n  connection.\n\nBackward-Incompatible Changes\n=============================\n\nThis release includes a couple of backward-incompatible changes, but most if\nnot all users will find 1.0 a drop-in replacement for 0.9.\n\n* Issue #50: Normalized API of environment marker support. Specifically,\n  removed line number and filename from SyntaxErrors when returned from\n  `pkg_resources.invalid_marker`. Any clients depending on the specific\n  string representation of exceptions returned by that function may need to\n  be updated to account for this change.\n* Issue #50: SyntaxErrors generated by `pkg_resources.invalid_marker` are\n  normalized for cross-implementation consistency.\n* Removed ``--ignore-conflicts-at-my-risk`` and ``--delete-conflicting``\n  options to easy_install. These options have been deprecated since 0.6a11.\n\n-----\n0.9.8\n-----\n\n* Issue #53: Fix NameErrors in `_vcs_split_rev_from_url`.\n\n-----\n0.9.7\n-----\n\n* Issue #49: Correct AttributeError on PyPy where a hashlib.HASH object does\n  not have a `.name` attribute.\n* Issue #34: Documentation now refers to bootstrap script in code repository\n  referenced by bookmark.\n* Add underscore-separated keys to environment markers (markerlib).\n\n-----\n0.9.6\n-----\n\n* Issue #44: Test failure on Python 2.4 when MD5 hash doesn't have a `.name`\n  attribute.\n\n-----\n0.9.5\n-----\n\n* Python #17980: Fix security vulnerability in SSL certificate validation.\n\n-----\n0.9.4\n-----\n\n* Issue #43: Fix issue (introduced in 0.9.1) with version resolution when\n  upgrading over other releases of Setuptools.\n\n-----\n0.9.3\n-----\n\n* Issue #42: Fix new ``AttributeError`` introduced in last fix.\n\n-----\n0.9.2\n-----\n\n* Issue #42: Fix regression where blank checksums would trigger an\n  ``AttributeError``.\n\n-----\n0.9.1\n-----\n\n* Distribute #386: Allow other positional and keyword arguments to os.open.\n* Corrected dependency on certifi mis-referenced in 0.9.\n\n---\n0.9\n---\n\n* `package_index` now validates hashes other than MD5 in download links.\n\n---\n0.8\n---\n\n* Code base now runs on Python 2.4 - Python 3.3 without Python 2to3\n  conversion.\n\n-----\n0.7.8\n-----\n\n* Distribute #375: Yet another fix for yet another regression.\n\n-----\n0.7.7\n-----\n\n* Distribute #375: Repair AttributeError created in last release (redo).\n* Issue #30: Added test for get_cache_path.\n\n-----\n0.7.6\n-----\n\n* Distribute #375: Repair AttributeError created in last release.\n\n-----\n0.7.5\n-----\n\n* Issue #21: Restore Python 2.4 compatibility in ``test_easy_install``.\n* Distribute #375: Merged additional warning from Distribute 0.6.46.\n* Now honor the environment variable\n  ``SETUPTOOLS_DISABLE_VERSIONED_EASY_INSTALL_SCRIPT`` in addition to the now\n  deprecated ``DISTRIBUTE_DISABLE_VERSIONED_EASY_INSTALL_SCRIPT``.\n\n-----\n0.7.4\n-----\n\n* Issue #20: Fix comparison of parsed SVN version on Python 3.\n\n-----\n0.7.3\n-----\n\n* Issue #1: Disable installation of Windows-specific files on non-Windows systems.\n* Use new sysconfig module with Python 2.7 or >=3.2.\n\n-----\n0.7.2\n-----\n\n* Issue #14: Use markerlib when the `parser` module is not available.\n* Issue #10: ``ez_setup.py`` now uses HTTPS to download setuptools from PyPI.\n\n-----\n0.7.1\n-----\n\n* Fix NameError (Issue #3) again - broken in bad merge.\n\n---\n0.7\n---\n\n* Merged Setuptools and Distribute. See docs/merge.txt for details.\n\nAdded several features that were slated for setuptools 0.6c12:\n\n* Index URL now defaults to HTTPS.\n* Added experimental environment marker support. Now clients may designate a\n  PEP-426 environment marker for \"extra\" dependencies. Setuptools uses this\n  feature in ``setup.py`` for optional SSL and certificate validation support\n  on older platforms. Based on Distutils-SIG discussions, the syntax is\n  somewhat tentative. There should probably be a PEP with a firmer spec before\n  the feature should be considered suitable for use.\n* Added support for SSL certificate validation when installing packages from\n  an HTTPS service.\n\n-----\n0.7b4\n-----\n\n* Issue #3: Fixed NameError in SSL support.\n\n------\n0.6.49\n------\n\n* Move warning check in ``get_cache_path`` to follow the directory creation\n  to avoid errors when the cache path does not yet exist. Fixes the error\n  reported in Distribute #375.\n\n------\n0.6.48\n------\n\n* Correct AttributeError in ``ResourceManager.get_cache_path`` introduced in\n  0.6.46 (redo).\n\n------\n0.6.47\n------\n\n* Correct AttributeError in ``ResourceManager.get_cache_path`` introduced in\n  0.6.46.\n\n------\n0.6.46\n------\n\n* Distribute #375: Issue a warning if the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE or otherwise\n  customized egg cache location specifies a directory that's group- or\n  world-writable.\n\n------\n0.6.45\n------\n\n* Distribute #379: ``distribute_setup.py`` now traps VersionConflict as well,\n  restoring ability to upgrade from an older setuptools version.\n\n------\n0.6.44\n------\n\n* ``distribute_setup.py`` has been updated to allow Setuptools 0.7 to\n  satisfy use_setuptools.\n\n------\n0.6.43\n------\n\n* Distribute #378: Restore support for Python 2.4 Syntax (regression in 0.6.42).\n\n------\n0.6.42\n------\n\n* External links finder no longer yields duplicate links.\n* Distribute #337: Moved site.py to setuptools/site-patch.py (graft of very old\n  patch from setuptools trunk which inspired PR #31).\n\n------\n0.6.41\n------\n\n* Distribute #27: Use public api for loading resources from zip files rather than\n  the private method `_zip_directory_cache`.\n* Added a new function ``easy_install.get_win_launcher`` which may be used by\n  third-party libraries such as buildout to get a suitable script launcher.\n\n------\n0.6.40\n------\n\n* Distribute #376: brought back cli.exe and gui.exe that were deleted in the\n  previous release.\n\n------\n0.6.39\n------\n\n* Add support for console launchers on ARM platforms.\n* Fix possible issue in GUI launchers where the subsystem was not supplied to\n  the linker.\n* Launcher build script now refactored for robustness.\n* Distribute #375: Resources extracted from a zip egg to the file system now also\n  check the contents of the file against the zip contents during each\n  invocation of get_resource_filename.\n\n------\n0.6.38\n------\n\n* Distribute #371: The launcher manifest file is now installed properly.\n\n------\n0.6.37\n------\n\n* Distribute #143: Launcher scripts, including easy_install itself, are now\n  accompanied by a manifest on 32-bit Windows environments to avoid the\n  Installer Detection Technology and thus undesirable UAC elevation described\n  in `this Microsoft article\n  <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709628%28WS.10%29.aspx>`_.\n\n------\n0.6.36\n------\n\n* Pull Request #35: In Buildout #64, it was reported that\n  under Python 3, installation of distutils scripts could attempt to copy\n  the ``__pycache__`` directory as a file, causing an error, apparently only\n  under Windows. Easy_install now skips all directories when processing\n  metadata scripts.\n\n------\n0.6.35\n------\n\n\nNote this release is backward-incompatible with distribute 0.6.23-0.6.34 in\nhow it parses version numbers.\n\n* Distribute #278: Restored compatibility with distribute 0.6.22 and setuptools\n  0.6.

This change should address\n  `virtualenv #359 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/359>`_ as long\n  as the system encoding is UTF-8 or the IO encoding is specified in the\n  environment, i.e.::\n\n     PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 pip install numpy\n\n* Fix for encoding issue when installing from Windows executable on Python 3.\n* Distribute #323: Allow `setup_requires` requirements to supercede installed\n  requirements. Added some new keyword arguments to existing pkg_resources\n  methods.

(Fixes a bug in the experimental shared\n   library build support.)\n\n * Fix to allow unpacked eggs containing native libraries to fail more\n   gracefully under Google App Engine (with an ``ImportError`` loading the\n   C-based module, instead of getting a ``NameError``).\n\n-----\n0.6c7\n-----\n\n * Fixed ``distutils.filelist.findall()`` crashing on broken symlinks, and\n   ``egg_info`` command failing on new, uncommitted SVN directories.\n\n * Fix import problems with nested namespace packages installed via\n   ``--root`` or ``--single-version-externally-managed``, due to the\n   parent package not having the child package as an attribute.\n\n-----\n0.6c6\n-----\n\n * Added ``--egg-path`` option to ``develop`` command, allowing you to force\n   ``.egg-link`` files to use relative paths (allowing them to be shared across\n   platforms on a networked drive).\n\n * Fix not building binary RPMs correctly.\n\n * Fix \"eggsecutables\" (such as setuptools' own egg) only being runnable with\n   bash-compatible shells.\n\n * Fix ``#!`` parsing problems in Windows ``.exe`` script wrappers, when there\n   was whitespace inside a quoted argument or at the end of the ``#!`` line\n   (a regression introduced in 0.6c4).\n\n * Fix ``test`` command possibly failing if an older version of the project\n   being tested was installed on ``sys.path`` ahead of the test source\n   directory.\n\n * Fix ``find_packages()`` treating ``ez_setup`` and directories with ``.`` in\n   their names as packages.\n\n-----\n0.6c5\n-----\n\n * Fix uploaded ``bdist_rpm`` packages being described as ``bdist_egg``\n   packages under Python versions less than 2.5.\n\n * Fix uploaded ``bdist_wininst`` packages being described as suitable for\n   \"any\" version by Python 2.5, even if a ``--target-version`` was specified.\n\n-----\n0.6c4\n-----\n\n * Overhauled Windows script wrapping to support ``bdist_wininst`` better.\n   Scripts installed with ``bdist_wininst`` will always use ``#!python.exe`` or\n   ``#!pythonw.exe`` as the executable name (even when built on non-Windows\n   platforms!), and the wrappers will look for the executable in the script's\n   parent directory (which should find the right version of Python).\n\n * Fix ``upload`` command not uploading files built by ``bdist_rpm`` or\n   ``bdist_wininst`` under Python 2.3 and 2.4.\n\n * Add support for \"eggsecutable\" headers: a ``#!/bin/sh`` script that is\n   prepended to an ``.egg`` file to allow it to be run as a script on Unix-ish\n   platforms.  (This is mainly so that setuptools itself can have a single-file\n   installer on Unix, without doing multiple downloads, dealing with firewalls,\n   etc.)\n\n * Fix problem with empty revision numbers in Subversion 1.4 ``entries`` files\n\n * Use cross-platform relative paths in ``easy-install.pth`` when doing\n   ``develop`` and the source directory is a subdirectory of the installation\n   target directory.\n\n * Fix a problem installing eggs with a system packaging tool if the project\n   contained an implicit namespace package; for example if the ``setup()``\n   listed a namespace package ``foo.bar`` without explicitly listing ``foo``\n   as a namespace package.\n\n-----\n0.6c3\n-----\n\n * Fixed breakages caused by Subversion 1.4's new \"working copy\" format\n\n-----\n0.6c2\n-----\n\n * The ``ez_setup`` module displays the conflicting version of setuptools (and\n   its installation location) when a script requests a version that's not\n   available.\n\n * Running ``setup.py develop`` on a setuptools-using project will now install\n   setuptools if needed, instead of only downloading the egg.\n\n-----\n0.6c1\n-----\n\n * Fixed ``AttributeError`` when trying to download a ``setup_requires``\n   dependency when a distribution lacks a ``dependency_links`` setting.\n\n * Made ``zip-safe`` and ``not-zip-safe`` flag files contain a single byte, so\n   as to play better with packaging tools that complain about zero-length\n   files.\n\n * Made ``setup.py develop`` respect the ``--no-deps`` option, which it\n   previously was ignoring.\n\n * Support ``extra_path`` option to ``setup()`` when ``install`` is run in\n   backward-compatibility mode.\n\n * Source distributions now always include a ``setup.cfg`` file that explicitly\n   sets ``egg_info`` options such that they produce an identical version number\n   to the source distribution's version number.  (Previously, the default\n   version number could be different due to the use of ``--tag-date``, or if\n   the version was overridden on the command line that built the source\n   distribution.)\n\n-----\n0.6b4\n-----\n\n * Fix ``register`` not obeying name/version set by ``egg_info`` command, if\n   ``egg_info`` wasn't explicitly run first on the same command line.\n\n * Added ``--no-date`` and ``--no-svn-revision`` options to ``egg_info``\n   command, to allow suppressing tags configured in ``setup.cfg``.\n\n * Fixed redundant warnings about missing ``README`` file(s); it should now\n   appear only if you are actually a source distribution.\n\n-----\n0.6b3\n-----\n\n * Fix ``bdist_egg`` not including files in subdirectories of ``.egg-info``.\n\n * Allow ``.py`` files found by the ``include_package_data`` option to be\n   automatically included.  Remove duplicate data file matches if both\n   ``include_package_data`` and ``package_data`` are used to refer to the same\n   files.\n\n-----\n0.6b1\n-----\n\n * Strip ``module`` from the end of compiled extension modules when computing\n   the name of a ``.py`` loader/wrapper.  (Python's import machinery ignores\n   this suffix when searching for an extension module.)\n\n------\n0.6a11\n------\n\n * Added ``test_loader`` keyword to support custom test loaders\n\n * Added ``setuptools.file_finders`` entry point group to allow implementing\n   revision control plugins.\n\n * Added ``--identity`` option to ``upload`` command.\n\n * Added ``dependency_links`` to allow specifying URLs for ``--find-links``.\n\n * Enhanced test loader to scan packages as well as modules, and call\n   ``additional_tests()`` if present to get non-unittest tests.\n\n * Support namespace packages in conjunction with system packagers, by omitting\n   the installation of any ``__init__.py`` files for namespace packages, and\n   adding a special ``.pth`` file to create a working package in\n   ``sys.modules``.\n\n * Made ``--single-version-externally-managed`` automatic when ``--root`` is\n   used, so that most system packagers won't require special support for\n   setuptools.\n\n * Fixed ``setup_requires``, ``tests_require``, etc. not using ``setup.cfg`` or\n   other configuration files for their option defaults when installing, and\n   also made the install use ``--multi-version`` mode so that the project\n   directory doesn't need to support .pth files.\n\n * ``MANIFEST.in`` is now forcibly closed when any errors occur while reading\n   it.  Previously, the file could be left open and the actual error would be\n   masked by problems trying to remove the open file on Windows systems.\n\n------\n0.6a10\n------\n\n * Fixed the ``develop`` command ignoring ``--find-links``.\n\n-----\n0.6a9\n-----\n\n * The ``sdist`` command no longer uses the traditional ``MANIFEST`` file to\n   create source distributions.  ``MANIFEST.in`` is still read and processed,\n   as are the standard defaults and pruning.  But the manifest is built inside\n   the project's ``.egg-info`` directory as ``SOURCES.txt``, and it is rebuilt\n   every time the ``egg_info`` command is run.\n\n * Added the ``include_package_data`` keyword to ``setup()``, allowing you to\n   automatically include any package data listed in revision control or\n   ``MANIFEST.in``\n\n * Added the ``exclude_package_data`` keyword to ``setup()``, allowing you to\n   trim back files included via the ``package_data`` and\n   ``include_package_data`` options.\n\n * Fixed ``--tag-svn-revision`` not working when run from a source\n   distribution.\n\n * Added warning for namespace packages with missing ``declare_namespace()``\n\n * Added ``tests_require`` keyword to ``setup()``, so that e.g. packages\n   requiring ``nose`` to run unit tests can make this dependency optional\n   unless the ``test`` command is run.\n\n * Made all commands that use ``easy_install`` respect its configuration\n   options, as this was causing some problems with ``setup.py install``.\n\n * Added an ``unpack_directory()`` driver to ``setuptools.archive_util``, so\n   that you can process a directory tree through a processing filter as if it\n   were a zipfile or tarfile.\n\n * Added an internal ``install_egg_info`` command to use as part of old-style\n   ``install`` operations, that installs an ``.egg-info`` directory with the\n   package.\n\n * Added a ``--single-version-externally-managed`` option to the ``install``\n   command so that you can more easily wrap a \"flat\" egg in a system package.\n\n * Enhanced ``bdist_rpm`` so that it installs single-version eggs that\n   don't rely on a ``.pth`` file.  The ``--no-egg`` option has been removed,\n   since all RPMs are now built in a more backwards-compatible format.\n\n * Support full roundtrip translation of eggs to and from ``bdist_wininst``\n   format.  Running ``bdist_wininst`` on a setuptools-based package wraps the\n   egg in an .exe that will safely install it as an egg (i.e., with metadata\n   and entry-point wrapper scripts), and ``easy_install`` can turn the .exe\n   back into an ``.egg`` file or directory and install it as such.\n\n\n-----\n0.6a8\n-----\n\n * Fixed some problems building extensions when Pyrex was installed, especially\n   with Python 2.4 and/or packages using SWIG.\n\n * Made ``develop`` command accept all the same options as ``easy_install``,\n   and use the ``easy_install`` command's configuration settings as defaults.\n\n * Made ``egg_info --tag-svn-revision`` fall back to extracting the revision\n   number from ``PKG-INFO`` in case it is being run on a source distribution of\n   a snapshot taken from a Subversion-based project.\n\n * Automatically detect ``.dll``, ``.so`` and ``.dylib`` files that are being\n   installed as data, adding them to ``native_libs.txt`` automatically.\n\n * Fixed some problems with fresh checkouts of projects that don't include\n   ``.egg-info/PKG-INFO`` under revision control and put the project's source\n   code directly in the project directory.  If such a package had any\n   requirements that get processed before the ``egg_info`` command can be run,\n   the setup scripts would fail with a \"Missing 'Version:' header and/or\n   PKG-INFO file\" error, because the egg runtime interpreted the unbuilt\n   metadata in a directory on ``sys.path`` (i.e. the current directory) as\n   being a corrupted egg.  Setuptools now monkeypatches the distribution\n   metadata cache to pretend that the egg has valid version information, until\n   it has a chance to make it actually be so (via the ``egg_info`` command).\n\n-----\n0.6a5\n-----\n\n * Fixed missing gui/cli .exe files in distribution.  Fixed bugs in tests.\n\n-----\n0.6a3\n-----\n\n * Added ``gui_scripts`` entry point group to allow installing GUI scripts\n   on Windows and other platforms.  (The special handling is only for Windows;\n   other platforms are treated the same as for ``console_scripts``.)\n\n-----\n0.6a2\n-----\n\n * Added ``console_scripts`` entry point group to allow installing scripts\n   without the need to create separate script files.  On Windows, console\n   scripts get an ``.exe`` wrapper so you can just type their name.  On other\n   platforms, the scripts are written without a file extension.\n\n-----\n0.6a1\n-----\n\n * Added support for building \"old-style\" RPMs that don't install an egg for\n   the target package, using a ``--no-egg`` option.\n\n * The ``build_ext`` command now works better when using the ``--inplace``\n   option and multiple Python versions.  It now makes sure that all extensions\n   match the current Python version, even if newer copies were built for a\n   different Python version.\n\n * The ``upload`` command no longer attaches an extra ``.zip`` when uploading\n   eggs, as PyPI now supports egg uploads without trickery.\n\n * The ``ez_setup`` script/module now displays a warning before downloading\n   the setuptools egg, and attempts to check the downloaded egg against an\n   internal MD5 checksum table.\n\n * Fixed the ``--tag-svn-revision`` option of ``egg_info`` not finding the\n   latest revision number; it was using the revision number of the directory\n   containing ``setup.py``, not the highest revision number in the project.\n\n * Added ``eager_resources`` setup argument\n\n * The ``sdist`` command now recognizes Subversion \"deleted file\" entries and\n   does not include them in source distributions.\n\n * ``setuptools`` now embeds itself more thoroughly into the distutils, so that\n   other distutils extensions (e.g. py2exe, py2app) will subclass setuptools'\n   versions of things, rather than the native distutils ones.\n\n * Added ``entry_points`` and ``setup_requires`` arguments to ``setup()``;\n   ``setup_requires`` allows you to automatically find and download packages\n   that are needed in order to *build* your project (as opposed to running it).\n\n * ``setuptools`` now finds its commands, ``setup()`` argument validators, and\n   metadata writers using entry points, so that they can be extended by\n   third-party packages.  See `Creating distutils Extensions\n   <http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#creating-distutils-extensions>`_\n   for more details.\n\n * The vestigial ``depends`` command has been removed.  It was never finished\n   or documented, and never would have worked without EasyInstall - which it\n   pre-dated and was never compatible with.\n\n------\n0.5a12\n------\n\n * The zip-safety scanner now checks for modules that might be used with\n   ``python -m``, and marks them as unsafe for zipping, since Python 2.4 can't\n   handle ``-m`` on zipped modules.\n\n------\n0.5a11\n------\n\n * Fix breakage of the \"develop\" command that was caused by the addition of\n   ``--always-unzip`` to the ``easy_install`` command.\n\n-----\n0.5a9\n-----\n\n * Include ``svn:externals`` directories in source distributions as well as\n   normal subversion-controlled files and directories.\n\n * Added ``exclude=patternlist`` option to ``setuptools.find_packages()``\n\n * Changed --tag-svn-revision to include an \"r\" in front of the revision number\n   for better readability.\n\n * Added ability to build eggs without including source files (except for any\n   scripts, of course), using the ``--exclude-source-files`` option to\n   ``bdist_egg``.\n\n * ``setup.py install`` now automatically detects when an \"unmanaged\" package\n   or module is going to be on ``sys.path`` ahead of a package being installed,\n   thereby preventing the newer version from being imported.  If this occurs,\n   a warning message is output to ``sys.stderr``, but installation proceeds\n   anyway.  The warning message informs the user what files or directories\n   need deleting, and advises them they can also use EasyInstall (with the\n   ``--delete-conflicting`` option) to do it automatically.\n\n * The ``egg_info`` command now adds a ``top_level.txt`` file to the metadata\n   directory that lists all top-level modules and packages in the distribution.\n   This is used by the ``easy_install`` command to find possibly-conflicting\n   \"unmanaged\" packages when installing the distribution.\n\n * Added ``zip_safe`` and ``namespace_packages`` arguments to ``setup()``.\n   Added package analysis to determine zip-safety if the ``zip_safe`` flag\n   is not given, and advise the author regarding what code might need changing.\n\n * Fixed the swapped ``-d`` and ``-b`` options of ``bdist_egg``.\n\n-----\n0.5a8\n-----\n\n * The \"egg_info\" command now always sets the distribution metadata to \"safe\"\n   forms of the distribution name and version, so that distribution files will\n   be generated with parseable names (i.e., ones that don't include '-' in the\n   name or version).  Also, this means that if you use the various ``--tag``\n   options of \"egg_info\", any distributions generated will use the tags in the\n   version, not just egg distributions.\n\n * Added support for defining command aliases in distutils configuration files,\n   under the \"[aliases]\" section.  To prevent recursion and to allow aliases to\n   call the command of the same name, a given alias can be expanded only once\n   per command-line invocation.  You can define new aliases with the \"alias\"\n   command, either for the local, global, or per-user configuration.\n\n * Added \"rotate\" command to delete old distribution files, given a set of\n   patterns to match and the number of files to keep.  (Keeps the most\n   recently-modified distribution files matching each pattern.)\n\n * Added \"saveopts\" command that saves all command-line options for the current\n   invocation to the local, global, or per-user configuration file.  Useful for\n   setting defaults without having to hand-edit a configuration file.\n\n * Added a \"setopt\" command that sets a single option in a specified distutils\n   configuration file.\n\n-----\n0.5a7\n-----\n\n * Added \"upload\" support for egg and source distributions, including a bug\n   fix for \"upload\" and a temporary workaround for lack of .egg support in\n   PyPI.\n\n-----\n0.5a6\n-----\n\n * Beefed up the \"sdist\" command so that if you don't have a MANIFEST.in, it\n   will include all files under revision control (CVS or Subversion) in the\n   current directory, and it will regenerate the list every time you create a\n   source distribution, not just when you tell it to.  This should make the\n   default \"do what you mean\" more often than the distutils' default behavior\n   did, while still retaining the old behavior in the presence of MANIFEST.in.\n\n * Fixed the \"develop\" command always updating .pth files, even if you\n   specified ``-n`` or ``--dry-run``.\n\n * Slightly changed the format of the generated version when you use\n   ``--tag-build`` on the \"egg_info\" command, so that you can make tagged\n   revisions compare *lower* than the version specified in setup.py (e.g. by\n   using ``--tag-build=dev``).\n\n-----\n0.5a5\n-----\n\n * Added ``develop`` command to ``setuptools``-based packages.  This command\n   installs an ``.egg-link`` pointing to the package's source directory, and\n   script wrappers that ``execfile()`` the source versions of the package's\n   scripts.  This lets you put your development checkout(s) on sys.path without\n   having to actually install them.  (To uninstall the link, use\n   use ``setup.py develop --uninstall``.)\n\n * Added ``egg_info`` command to ``setuptools``-based packages.  This command\n   just creates or updates the \"projectname.egg-info\" directory, without\n   building an egg.  (It's used by the ``bdist_egg``, ``test``, and ``develop``\n   commands.)\n\n * Enhanced the ``test`` command so that it doesn't install the package, but\n   instead builds any C extensions in-place, updates the ``.egg-info``\n   metadata, adds the source directory to ``sys.path``, and runs the tests\n   directly on the source.  This avoids an \"unmanaged\" installation of the\n   package to ``site-packages`` or elsewhere.\n\n * Made ``easy_install`` a standard ``setuptools`` command, moving it from\n   the ``easy_install`` module to ``setuptools.command.easy_install``.  Note\n   that if you were importing or extending it, you must now change your imports\n   accordingly.  ``easy_install.py`` is still installed as a script, but not as\n   a module.\n\n-----\n0.5a4\n-----\n\n * Setup scripts using setuptools can now list their dependencies directly in\n   the setup.py file, without having to manually create a ``depends.txt`` file.\n   The ``install_requires`` and ``extras_require`` arguments to ``setup()``\n   are used to create a dependencies file automatically.  If you are manually\n   creating ``depends.txt`` right now, please switch to using these setup\n   arguments as soon as practical, because ``depends.txt`` support will be\n   removed in the 0.6 release cycle.  For documentation on the new arguments,\n   see the ``setuptools.dist.Distribution`` class.\n\n * Setup scripts using setuptools now always install using ``easy_install``\n   internally, for ease of uninstallation and upgrading.\n\n-----\n0.5a1\n-----\n\n * Added support for \"self-installation\" bootstrapping.  Packages can now\n   include ``ez_setup.py`` in their source distribution, and add the following\n   to their ``setup.py``, in order to automatically bootstrap installation of\n   setuptools as part of their setup process::\n\n    from ez_setup import use_setuptools\n    use_setuptools()\n\n    from setuptools import setup\n    # etc...\n\n-----\n0.4a2\n-----\n\n * Added ``ez_setup.py`` installer/bootstrap script to make initial setuptools\n   installation easier, and to allow distributions using setuptools to avoid\n   having to include setuptools in their source distribution.\n\n * All downloads are now managed by the ``PackageIndex`` class (which is now\n   subclassable and replaceable), so that embedders can more easily override\n   download logic, give download progress reports, etc.  The class has also\n   been moved to the new ``setuptools.package_index`` module.\n\n * The ``Installer`` class no longer handles downloading, manages a temporary\n   directory, or tracks the ``zip_ok`` option.  Downloading is now handled\n   by ``PackageIndex``, and ``Installer`` has become an ``easy_install``\n   command class based on ``setuptools.Command``.\n\n * There is a new ``setuptools.sandbox.run_setup()`` API to invoke a setup\n   script in a directory sandbox, and a new ``setuptools.archive_util`` module\n   with an ``unpack_archive()`` API.  These were split out of EasyInstall to\n   allow reuse by other tools and applications.\n\n * ``setuptools.Command`` now supports reinitializing commands using keyword\n   arguments to set/reset options.  Also, ``Command`` subclasses can now set\n   their ``command_consumes_arguments`` attribute to ``True`` in order to\n   receive an ``args`` option containing the rest of the command line.\n\n-----\n0.3a2\n-----\n\n * Added new options to ``bdist_egg`` to allow tagging the egg's version number\n   with a subversion revision number, the current date, or an explicit tag\n   value.  Run ``setup.py bdist_egg --help`` to get more information.\n\n * Misc. bug fixes\n\n-----\n0.3a1\n-----\n\n * Initial release.",
