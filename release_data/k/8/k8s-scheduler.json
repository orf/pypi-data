Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "description": "# k8s-Scheduler \n\nA Simple python based scheduler to schedule kubernetes jobs on crontab schedules. \n\nThis module will help schedule two kinds of jobs ,\n\n### Periodic \n\nThese are jobs which are supposed to run on a crontab schedule. This package would launch kubernetes pods \nas per the crontab schedule and monitor its runs.\n\n### Continuous runs \n\nThese are jobs which are supposed to be running continuously. Like a stream data input. This package would \nlaunch and monitor such continuous runs. If any of the run fails for any reason , this package would reschedule it. \n\n## Installation \nTo install the scheduler run below command, \n\n```\npip install k8s-scheduler \n```\n## Pre requisites \n\nAs the name suggests it's a job scheduler for kubernetes , so you would need a k8s instance apart from below mandatory and optional requirements.\n\n**Mongodb** - This acts as a data store for scheduler and results backend. \n\n**EFL / ELK Stack** - For logging and retrieving logs for a pod which is complete / running \n\n## Example usage \n\nUse the package to create a schedule entry in the backend , and use the run_scheduler method to start the scheduler in backrgound mode.\n\n```python\nfrom k8s_scheduler import Scheduler\nfrom k8s_scheduler.LogHandler import LogHandler\n\nscheduler = Scheduler(host=\"mongo_db_host\",\n                      username=\"user_name\",\n                      password=\"password\",\n                      db_name=\"test_schedule\")\n\n# Create schedules in the mongodb collection\njob_id_1 = scheduler.create_schedule(schedule=test_job_1)\njob_id_2 = scheduler.create_schedule(schedule=test_job_2)\njob_id_3 = scheduler.create_schedule(schedule=test_job_3)\n\n# Start Scheduler application \nscheduler.start_scheduler()\n```\n\n#### Schedule object type\n\nBelow is the template for the scheduler object.\n\n```python\nschedule_rec = {\n        \"schedule_name\": \"test-schedule-3-always\", # Name of the schedule\n        \"schedule_enabled\": 1,  # 1 for enabled 0 for disabled \n        \"schedule_description\": \"test always schedule with nginx and with service\",\n        \"schedule_type\": \"always\", # always is for streaming continuous jobs , periodic is for crontab based schedules \n        \"parallel_execution\": 0, # If two instances of the same job can run together\n        \"schedule_crontab\": { # Crontab schedule\n                            \"minute\": \"*/2\",\n                            \"hour\": \"*\",\n                            \"day_of_month\": \"*\",\n                            \"month\": \"*\",\n                            \"day_of_week\": \"*\"\n                            },\n        \"kubernetes_deployment_options\": {\n                                        \"name\": \"nginx-always-service\",  # name of the deployment\n                                        \"container_name\": \"nginx-always\", # Container name\n                                        \"container_image\": \"nginx:latest\", # Image \n                                        \"restart_policy\": \"\", # k8s Restart policy \n                                        \"ttl_seconds_after_finished\": 10, # Seconds until the job needs to be purged \n                                        \"env_vars\": [], # Env vars for the deployment \n                                        \"deploy_service\": 1,  # If a service needs to be deployed ? 1=yes 0=No\n                                        \"service_name\": \"nginx-service\", # Name of the service \n                                        \"port\": 8080, # Port exposed \n                                        \"target_port\": 80 # Port exposed \n                                        }\n        }\n\n```\n\n### Scheduler options \n\nBelow are the defaults when starting the scheduler, any of these params can be modified when creating a scheduler instance \n\n```python\nscheduler = Scheduler(db_name=\"k8s_scheduler\",  # Name of the Mongodb Database\n                      scheduler_collection_name=\"test_coll\", # Collection name for the scheduler\n                      result_db_collection='result_coll', # Collection name for the result store\n                      scheduler_poll_interval=10, # Polling interval for scheduler in seconds \n                      k8s_worker_namespace=\"test-namespace\", # k8s namespace in which pods are to be deployed \n                      k8s_config_file_path='/var/snap/microk8s/current/credentials/client.config', # k8s config file if running outside cluster\n                      **kwargs # connection args for mongodb \n                      )\n```\n\n\n## Log Retrieval and schedules history.  \n\nWe can retrieve logs of the jobs by connecting to ELK/EFK stack as below \n\n```python\nlog_handler = LogHandler(elastic_search_server='10.1.179.109',  # Elastic server\n                         elastic_search_port='9200', # port \n                         worker_namespace='test-namespace', # namespace of the workers \n                         index='logstash*') # logstash index \n\nlog_handler.get_logs(schedule_name=\"nginx-always\", # Name of the schedule  \n                     output_json=True) # If True Returns log as json object , if False prints log to console \n\n\n```\n\n## Testing the application  \n\nTo test the application we can use microk8s to spin up a k8s cluster and install required backends. \n\nInstall microk8s / k8s flavour\n\n    sudo snap install microk8s --classic\n\tmicrok8s enable helm3 ingress dashboard dns storage registry fluentd\n\tsudo snap alias microk8s.kubectl kubectl\n\tsudo snap alias microk8s.helm3 helm\n\nInstall backends \n\n\thelm install test-mongodb bitnami/mongodb -n test-mongodb --create-namespace --set architecture=replicaset\n\nOnce the stack is up use make file to create and clean the dns entries so that you can connect to database from outside the cluster. \n\n\n\n",
