As of now, the ADK can only run experiments locally. Remote interaction with the Quantum Network Explorer will be added in later updates. \r\n\r\nWith the ADK you can create your own application using the ``qne application create`` command (see Commands below). An application directory is generated for you with all the necessary files for you to configure and prepare for an experiment. When configuring an application, you specify the different roles and what types of inputs your application uses. In addition, you write the functionality of your application using the NetQASM library.\r\n\r\nAfter creating and configuring an application, you can create an experiment for it using the ``qne experiment create`` command. Also here an experiment directory is generated with all necessary files. When configuring your experiment you can give values to the inputs that were specified when creating your application. You also choose which channels and nodes you use in your network and which role is linked to which node. A network consists of channels and each channel consists of two nodes. The nodes can communicate with each other using the channel between them.\r\n\r\nOnce your experiment is configured you are ready to run it using the ``qne experiment run`` command. Your experiment is parsed and sent to the NetSquid simulator. After some time your experiment run will be finished and a results directory will be generated in which all the results of your experiment are stored.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n- A modern Linux or MacOS (10 or 11) 64-bit (x86_64) operating system. If you don\u2019t have Linux or MacOS you could run it via virtualization, e.g. using VirtualBox. If you have Windows 10 or 11 you can also use the [Bash on Ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) subsystem.\r\n- A [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) should be created and activated before creating an application.\r\n- Python version 3.7 or higher and pip version 19 or higher.\r\n- NetQASM makes use of SquidASM for which you need credentials in order to use it. These credentials can be obtained by registering on the forum of [NetSquid](https://forum.netsquid.org/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo install all the required packages, execute the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install qne-adk\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter installing the qne-adk, you can install SquidASM. Replace '{netsquid-user-name}' and '{netsquid-password}' with the credentials you registered on [NetSquid](https://forum.netsquid.org/):\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install squidasm --extra-index-url=https://{netsquid-user-name}:{netsquid-password}@pypi.netsquid.org\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow everything should be setup and ready in order to create your own applications and experiments and run them on the simulator!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\nThe QNE-ADK uses various commands to create and run your applications and experiments. All of the commands are listed below:\r\n\r\n<!--- QNE APPLICATION CREATE --->\r\n<details closed>\r\n<summary><b>qne application create</b></summary>\r\nCreate a new application in your current directory containing all the files that are needed to write your application. The application directory name will be based on the value given to <b>application</b>. Two child directories <b>src</b> and <b>config</b> will be created, along with the default files.\r\n<br></br>\r\n    \r\n```\r\nqne application create [OPTIONS] APPLICATION_NAME ROLES...\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n  APPLICATION_NAME  Name of the application  [required]\r\n  ROLES...
