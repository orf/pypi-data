The quickest way to check if the SDK is working is by running the\ncommand:\n\n```shell\nsynth-validate\n```\n\nThe first time this is run you will be asked if you have a licence key. If you\ndo not have one simply select \"no\" and the prompts will guide you in acquiring\none by entering your email address.\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/ZynbNNeSiiHRg9qHDBmGxsgBW.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/ZynbNNeSiiHRg9qHDBmGxsgBW)\n\nOnce you have set your licence key, the SDK will briefly verify the\ninstallation was successful.\n\nWith the SDK installed you are now able to get synthesizing! Check out our\n[quick start](https://docs.synthesized.io/sdk/latest/user_guide/tutorials/quickstart) or\n[user guides](https://docs.synthesized.io/sdk/latest/user_guide/) for\nways that the SDK can be put to use.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nBelow are the minimum dependencies required to run the SDK.\n\n|Package                               | Version |\n| ------------------------------------ | ------- |\n|[faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker)| `>=8.0` |\n|[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)|`>=3.4` |\n|[numpy](https://www.numpy.org)|`>=1.19.2` |\n|[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)|`>=1.2` |\n|[prompt-toolkit](https://pypi.org/project/prompt-toolkit/)|`>=3.0` |\n|[PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/)|`>=5.2` |\n|[rsa](https://stuvel.eu/rsa)|`>=4.7` |\n|[rstr](https://github.com/leapfrogonline/rstr)|`>=2.2` |\n|[scikit_learn](http://scikit-learn.org)|`>=0.23` |\n|[scipy](https://www.scipy.org)|`>=1.5` |\n|[seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)|`>=0.11` |\n|[synthesized_insight](https://synthesized.io)|`>=0.5` |\n|[tensorflow_privacy](https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy)|`<0.8, >=0.6` |\n|[tensorflow_probability](http://github.com/tensorflow/probability)|`>=0.14.0` |\n|[tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)|`>=2.6` |\n\n## Additional Technical Details\n\nThere is no explicit limit for the size of a dataset, this is limited by the\nsize of the RAM on the machine running the processing. More information can\nbe found in the [Benchmarks(https://docs.synthesized.io/sdk/latest/user_guide/benchmark) section.\n\nThe library can use a GPU but it is not required.\n",
