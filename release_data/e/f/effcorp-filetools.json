            "description": "# Efficient Corporates File Tools Utilities in Python\nFirst of all, Welcome to Efficient Corporates..! \nBefore you start reading the Documentation, let us please give you a small Disclaimer\n\n\n*At, Efficient Corporates (or Eff Corp as we call it), we believe that Coding is for everyone and \neveryone has the right to make their life simpler through use of automation.\nHence, we endeavor to make it simpler for non coders (like the people without Computer Science as their Major\nor even Commerce / Arts  background people)to make coding a daily habit . Since,\nwe believe on making things less technical and more practial, hence, it is possible that \nwe may not follow the best coding practices or documentation practice to ensure that \nusers get to understand easily , So.. PLEASE EXCUSE US  for that*\n\n\n\n### Lets know a bit about Efficient Corporates\n\nEfficient Corporates is an Open Knowledge Sharing Platform which works towards \nencouraging the HR, Sales , Opertions , Finance , Tax , Accounts or any other Professionals to \nadopt technology in their day to day office Working and automate their most boring repetitive\ntasks at Office (so that they can have a meaningful 9 to 5 job or WFH)\n\nWe have come up with our Second Module on FileTools Automation and we plan to come up with many more such \nmodules.\n\n### (Our First Module was effcorp-gst. [This is primarily for the practiciing Tax Professionals in India doing GST related work]\nIf you have not checked that out yet, we highly recommend you to to check that out, if you are someonw who work in GST)\n\n\n[Link to the Module effcorp-gst](https://pypi.org/project/effcorp-gst/):\n\nYou can also watch here the [Complete Video Tutorial on effcorp-gst](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaso8-OZjhbx9y5QuaNhVs-95_r6rqzP4):\n\n\n### Now, lets get back to this Module \"effcorp-filetools\"\n\nThis Module of filetools (is just like any any other python module like Pandas , Numpy, matplotlib) and has\nsome functions (pre defined actions) which help us to automate the files related tasks.\n\n*Again, if you are very new to Python, and have no Idea what's going on here, we strongly recommend you to \nfirst go through our very basic Python Tuitorial Especially designed for Finance Professionals and students*\n\nIn Our Youtube Channel \"Efficient Corporates\" [Python Tutorial for Absolute beginners by Effcient Corporates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E509BVUxrZg&list=PLaso8-OZjhbyTgqcLSxbusK2RpPu_c3lC):\n\n\nNow, what task does this module actually help us perform?\n\nBelow are the major utilities present in this module:\n\n### Utilities Present in the Current Latest Version of Eff Corp Filetools\n\n1. Search for Files in your Computer/ Laptop   \n2. Excel Related Tools\n3. Pdf Related Tools  \n4. Converting from one file format to another file format\n\n\nSo, these are the broad heading of the  functions this module performs.\n\nLet's read about each of these in details\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAs we mentioned that effcorp-filetools is like any other Python Modules like pandas, matplotlib, numpy,\nso, even this can be installed using the simple pip command as below. (Documentation available at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/effcorp-filetools/):)\n\n```pip install effcorp-filetools```\n\nThe Efficient Corporates Filetools will better run on Python 3.6 and above. \nIt is so because , we have used string formatting f literals which work only on python 3.6 and above\n\n\n## How to use?\n\nNow, lets see how do we use Pandas . We simply pip install it and then import the module saying\n\n\n```import pandas as pd```\n\nBut, there are some modules like Tkinter, where we write as \n\n```from tkinter import *```\n\nSo, in this case , though we have pip install effcorp-filetools , but the entry point to this module is\nset to the keyword \"gst\".\n\nThis means you can enter inside this module using the Keyword \"filetools\" only.\n\nQuite weird, but that is the way the module has been set up, So we will need to do the below to get inside the module\n\n```import filetools```\n\n##### OR\n\n```from filetools import filetools_utilities```\n\n\n***Below codes to import will not work***\n\n```import effcorp-filetools``` >>> Won't work\n\n\n```from effcorp-filetools import filetools``` >>> Won't work\n\n\n\n\n### Utilities Under this File Tools (Lets talk about thse One-By-One)\n\n### 1. Search for Files in your Computer/ Laptop \n\nMany times, we come across a situation where we want to search for certain file.\n\nOr May be search for files with particular extension.\n\nSo, won't it be wonderful , if you would get the names and the complete location of that files in an excel format\n\nTo make this easier, we have come up with 2 module depending upon your requirement.\n\n\n#### Requirement 1:\n\n##### 1.1 Searching particular extension in entire Laptop/ Computer System\n\nName of Function : **search_drives()**\n\n```buildoutcfg\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities\n\nfiletools_utilities.search_drives(\".pdf\")\n\n```\nNow, if you think that just tooo Long, you can shorten it like below:\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\nftu.search_drives(\".pdf\")\n\n```\n\n\nJust with these 2 lines of code, the program will search your entire system and find out the\n.pdf files in your system (i.e it will look inside your C drive, D Drive, E Drive, F drive and whatever drives your have)\n\n#### Just a small caution that, since thse will look for the extension in your entire system So these might take a bit longer time to run. So you will have to have that patience.\n\nThis program takes around 2 min - 10 min depending uoon the number of files you have in your system\n\n##### Output:\nYou will get an Excel file with beow 3 columns: (Excel will be stored in that same folder from where the code is run) \n\na. Name of the File of that Extension (i.e all pdf files in this case)\n\nb. Complete Location of that file\n\nc. Size of that File (in Kb)\n\n\nNow, what if you want to search only the D Drive , or may be only inside a particular folder only , which is inside C Drive.\n\nSo, you will need the Requirement 2:\n\n#### Requirement 2:\n\n##### 1.2 Searching particular extension file in particular Folder and inside its Subfolder\n\n\nName of Function : **search_folder()**\n\n\n```\n\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\n\nftu.search_folder(r\"C:\\Users\\Dell\\Documents\",\".pdf\")\n\n```\n\n***\n\n\n#### Requirement 3:\n\n##### 1.3 Searching particular extension file in particular Folder and inside its Subfolder BUT also fulfills certain name conditions\n\n\nName of Function : **search_files_condition()**\n\n```\n\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\n\nftu.search_files_condition(r\"C:\\Users\\Dell\\Documents\",\".pdf\",\"case_sensitive\"=False)\n\n```\n\nIn this we will specify the path In which we want to look for the particular extension file\nAlso, on running this, we will get a input box, where we ca specify the pettern in regex format.\n\nLike, if we want to find all files starting with \"E\", then we can simply give\nE.  in the input box. The . will mean that any number of character after E\n\nFor a complete regex documentation, you can also consider reading the Python Documentation\n\nLink : https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html\n\n***\n\n\n\n### 2. Excel Related Tools\n\n##### 2.1 Splitting Excel\nIn Finance, we have been working with excel files since a very long time.\nSo, many time we come across a situation in which we need to divide the Excel Files into different files or into multiple shets.\nUsually , this splitting is done based on certain columns (like Product wise, Department Wise) which is present inside that Excel File.\n\n##### 2.1.1 Splitting into Different Excel Sheets in single excel file\n\nNow, in this code, you will just need to specify the Excel Files and the columns name, \nwhich you want to Split and also the Column Name basic whose value you want to Split the data\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\nftu.split_excel(filepath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\Financial Sample.xlsx\",\n                cols=\"Month Name\",\n                sheet=\"Main\",\n                mode=\"sheets\")\n                \n```\n\n**NOTE**\nIn the above code, the function will read the file in that filepath variable.\n\nIt will read the sheet named \"Main\" and read the table in that Excel file.  Then, it will  select the column whose heading is \"Month Name\"\n\nThe Mode is selected as \"sheets\", so for each value in that column Named \"Month name\", a sheet will be created\n\nSo, here 12 sheets for each month will be created in a single file.\n\n\n##### 2.1.2 Splitting into Different Excel files\n\n\nSo, if you want to create different Excel files, instead of sheets, so use the mode as \"file\" \n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\nftu.split_excel(filepath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\Financial Sample.xlsx\",\n                cols=\"Month Name\",\n                sheet=1,\n                mode=\"file\")\n```\n\nThe code is same as above, just the mode is different.\n\nAlso, note that the sheet is mentioned as 1.\n\nThis means that the second sheet will be read (Python starts counting from Zero , so 1 means the second sheet)\n\n\n### Next Utility in Excel\n\nThis utility is around the combining of the Excel files\n\n##### 2.2 Combining Excel \n\nIf we have same data divided into multiple excel sheets or in multiple excel files,\nthen we can use this program to merge the data.\n\n##### 2.2.1 Combining the different Excel files\n\nSuppose we have a same sales ledger extracted from SAP or from Tally, for each month in separate excel files and we \nwant to consolidate it into a single excel file, then we can make use of this command.\n\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\n\nftu.combine_excel(folder = r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Excel Files\",\n                mode=\"file\",\n                sheet=0)\n\n```\nThe above code will read all the excel file in that folder named \"Excel Files\"\n\nSince the mode is mentioned as \"file\" it means that we have data in differet excel files.\n\nAlso, sheet=0 , means that  program will read the first sheet of each excel file.\n\nIf we want program to read 4th Sheet of each excel file, then we need to mention sheet=3\n\nAlternatively, you can also give the name of the sheet like \"Data\" or \"Master\".\n\nIn this case, the name of the sheet must be same in all the excel files. \n\nAfter reading as per the parameters mentioned, the program will give a single sheet as Output.\n\n**NOTE** \nHere, If you want to merge Excel files , you DO NOT need to provide the complete filepath , You just need to give the folder path.\nThis program will automatically read all excel files which are in that folder.\nPlease note that all the files must have the exact same headings.\n\nIf the heading is different e.g \"Month\" & \"Month Name\", then this program will create keep two columns \"Month \" and \"Month Name\"\n\nSo, all the headings should be exactly same. \n\nOrder / Sequence of the columns is not Important.\n\n\n\n##### 2.2.2 Combining the different Excel Sheets in same Excel file\n\n\n\nNext, lets Suppose we have a same sales ledger extracted from SAP or from Tally, for each month in separate sheets but within a same excel file,\n\nNow, if we want to consolidate it into a single excel file, then we can make use of this command.\n\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\n\nftu.combine_excel(folder = r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Excel Files\\ The Excel.xlsx\",\n                mode=\"sheets\")\n\n```\n\n\n***\n\n**NOTE**\n\nSo, here you need to note the below points:\n\n1. In folder = r''' , we have given the complete Excel file path and not just the folder path\n\n2. Mode need to be given as \"sheets\"\n\n3. The parameter sheet=0 , need not be given as this program will read all the sheets in that 1 excel file.\n\n\n\n\n### 3. Pdf Related Tools\n\nHere we will be looking at multiple tools, which let us do the various tasks of office \nwith just a single line of code\n\n\n#### 3.1 Combining Pdf\n\n##### Variant 1: Combining pdf one after another\n\nIt is a very easy function , and can be done by using most of the free sites online.\n\nBut, if you want protect the confidentiality of your data, then better do it on your own. In your local system, without uploading it online\n\nSo,below is a program that you can use to combine the pdf files in seconds without need to upload it in internet\n\n```\n\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\"\n\nftu.combine_pdf(filepath=path)\n\n```\n\n\n##### Variant 2: Combining pdf odd even pages\n\nIn this case, if we have multiple pdf files, some have od number of pages and some have even number of pages.\n\nBw, if all such files are combined as it is (as we discussed in Variant 1), then, if we do the both side \nprint of the combined pdf, then first page of the pdf after the odd pages pdf will appear at the backside\nSo, to prevent this, we have this function \n\nThis will add a blank page if the total number of pages in the pdf file is odd numbered.\n\nIn this was the both side print out of the consolidated pdf file can be easily taken.\nSo,below is a program that you can use to combine the pdf files in seconds without need to upload it in internet\n\n```\n\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\"\n\nftu.combine_pdf_oddeven(filepath=path)\n\n```\n\n***\n#### 3.2 Splitting Pdf\n\nThis module is used for the splitting of the excel file.\nSplitting can be done in many ways\n\nCode for Splitting the pdf file will be as below:\n\n\nThere are Multiple ways of Spliting the excel file\n\n**3.2.1 type=\"page_wise\"** \n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.split_pdf(filepath=path,type=\"page_wise\",set=1)\n\n```\n\nIn case of a pdf with 16 pages is splitte using type \"pages wise\", \nit will give 16 pdf with 1 pages each.\n\nFirst pdf will have page 1\nSecond pdf will have page 2\nThird pdf will have page 3 ..and so on...\n\n\n**3.2.2 type=\"cummulative\"**\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.split_pdf(filepath=path,type=\"cummulative\",set=1)\n\n```\nIn this case, \n\nfirst pdf will have page 1 page\nSecond pdf will have Page 1 & 2\nThird Pdf will have Page 1 & 2 & 3\n.\n.\n.\n15th Pdf will have Page 1-15\nLast pdf will have All 16 pages\n\nSo, in this way the pages keeps on accumlating. In this manner, the 16 paged pdf  will be splitted into 16 files.\n\n\n**3.2.3 type=\"oddeven\"**\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.split_pdf(filepath=path,type=\"oddeven\",set=1)\n```\n\nThe odd pages will be splitted in one file and the even pages will be splitted in another file\n\n\n**3.2.4 type=\"ranges\"**\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.split_pdf(filepath=path,type=\"ranges\",set=5)\n\n```\nUnder this, we need to specify, at what range/ interval do you want to break.\n\nFor Example: If a pdf has 16 pages, and the type is selcted as ranges and the Set is given as 5.\n\nSo, it basically tell the system to make pdf files with 5 pages each.\n\nSo, since the pdf has 16 pages, the program will make total 4 files\n\nFirst 3 will have 5 pages each and the fourth one will have 1 page i.e the remaining page\n\n\n\n\n**3.2.5 type=\"split_equal\"**\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.split_pdf(filepath=path,type=\"split_equal\",set=4)\n```\n\nIn this cases, the program will return 4 pdf files with equal page numbers\n\nIf a pdf have 16 pages , this will return 4 pdf with 4 pages each\n\n\n\n##### If you want any other kind of split, do provide your feedback.\n##### We will try to include that in our future versions\n\n***\n\n#### 3.3 Sorting Pdf\n\nThis function will reverse the order of the pdf file\n\nLast page will be the first page ,  second last page will be second page.... and first page will be the last page\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\nfilepath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.sort_pdf(filepath)\n```\n\nCurrently,we have only one type of sorting i.e reverse, in future versions , we may come up with more\nsorting oprtions (Feel free to give your feedbacks on efficientcorporates.info@gmail.com)\n\n***\n\n##### 3.4 Encrypting Pdf\n\n**3.4.1** Encrypting the pdf files with the default Password\n\nIn the below code, we have given only provided the path of the file, so the default password ie. Password@1 will be the password.\n\nThe pdf file will get encrypted with this password and saved as a new file.\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.encrypt_pdf(filepath=path, type=\"function\")\n```\n\n**3.4.2** Encrypting the pdf files with the different Password\n\nIn the below code, we have specified the password within the function, hence the pdf file \"new_File.pdf\" will be enrypted with the password \"Effcorp@11\"\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.encrypt_pdf(filepath=path, password=\"Effcorp@11\", type=\"function\")\n```\n\n\n**3.4.3** Encrypting the pdf files with user Defined password\n\nNOw, if we want to ask the user , the password he wants to set for the pdf file,\nin that case, we need not give the password and can set the type as \"user\"\n\nOn running this code, the pdf file new_File.pdf, will be selected\n\nThen user will be asked to enter the password he wants to set for the said pdf file.\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.encrypt_pdf(filepath=path, type=\"user\")\n```\n***\n\n##### 3.5 Decrypting Pdf\n\n**3.5.1** Decrypting the pdf files with the Password given inside function\n\n**Let us first make it clear that, here we are not cracking the password.\n\nWe are simply decrypting the pdf file with password provided.\n\nPasword must be known by you and this function will simply remove the password and save the file as a normal pdf file with no password**\n\nSo, writing the code will be as given below:\n\nIn the below case, we have  provided the path of the pdf file which is to be decrypted.\n\nFurther, we have also provided the password for decrypting\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File_encrypted.pdf\"\n\nftu.decrypt_pdf(filepath=path, password=\"Finance@11\", type=\"function\")\n```\n\nThis will save a new file in same folder without any password\n\n***\n\n##### 3.6 Numbering the Pdf File\n\nThis will add page numbers to your pdf file.\n\nSimply the path of the pdf files needs to be mentioned.\n\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\nftu.addnumber_pdf(filepath=path)\n```\n\n***\n\n##### 3.7 Delete Selected Pdf Pages\n\nThe code will be as below:\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\n\nftu.delete_pdfpage(path)\n\n```\nOn running this code, it will ask you for the below:\n\n**The pdf file new_File.pdf has been selected**\n\n**Enter no.of pages to delete :**\n\nSo, here you need to provide how many number of Pages to delete. ike 5 or 7 or 10\n\nAfter this, it will ask you, which pages to delete...\n\n**Enter page numbers(with spaces no commas) :**\n\nSo, if you want to delete Page num 4, page 6 & page 9\n\nYou need to give the input as 4 6 9 \n\n(Do not give any comma or hiphen, simply type the pages number with spaces)\n\n***\n\n#### 3.8 Rotating Pdf\n\n**3.8.1 Rotating all pages in certin direction**\n\nYou need to provide the path of the pdf file, and simply provide the degree at which rotation is to be done.\n\nRotation degrees to be given in multiple of 90\n\nRotation will take place \"Clockwise\"\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\n\nftu.rotate_pdfpage(filepath=path,type=\"normal\",degree=180)\n\n```\n\n\n**3.8.2 Rotating odd pages in certin direction & even pges in other direction**\n\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\npath=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Pdf Files\\new_File.pdf\"\n\n\nftu.rotate_pdfpage(filepath=path,type=\"oddeven\",odd_degree=-90,even_degree=180)\n\n```\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n### 4. Conversion from One File Format to Another\n\n\n\n#####  Excel to PDF Conversion\n\nSo, if there are multiple excel files that you want to convert pdf to , you \ncan very well make use of this function and run your files in a loop to convert all your \nexcel files into pdf\n\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\n\nComplete_file_path=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Excel Files\\Excel_file.xlsx\"\n\n\nftu.excel_to_pdf(Complete_file_path)\n\n```\nNote: You will have to ensure that the excel file has the contents in\na printable manner.\n\nPrint area must be set in the excel file.\n\n\n#####  Word to pdf  Conversion\n\nUsing this function , you can easily convert any number of word files into a pdf files\n\n\n```\nfrom filetools import filetools_utilities as ftu\n\n\nComplete_file_path=r\"F:\\New Folder \\MODULES\\Important\\ Word Files\\My_file.docx\"\n\n\nftu.word_to_pdf(Complete_file_path)\n\n```\n\n\n#####  Pdf to Word Conversion\n\nMany times you will need to edit a pdf file.
