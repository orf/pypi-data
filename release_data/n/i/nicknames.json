Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n        \n           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n        \n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n        \n           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n        \n              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n              replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n              same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n              identification within third-party archives.\n        \n           Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}\n        \n           Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n           you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n           You may obtain a copy of the License at\n        \n               http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n        \n           Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n           distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n           WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n           See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n           limitations under the License.",

Any help from\npeople to clean this list up and add to it is greatly appreciated.\nThe first name in a line is the canonical name, and the rest are nicknames\nfor that name.\n\nThis lookup file was initially created by mining this\n[genealogy page](https://www.caagri.org/nicknames.html).\nBecause the lookup originates from a dataset used for genealogy purposes there\nare old names that aren't commonly used these days, but there are recent ones\nas well. Examples are \"gregory\", \"greg\", or \"geoffrey\", \"geoff\". There was also\na significant effort to make it machine readable, i.e. separate it with commas,\nremove human conventions like \"rickie(y)\" would need to be made into two\ndifferent names \"rickie\", and \"ricky\".\n\nThis project was created by [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/) -\n[Web Science and Digital Libraries Research Group](http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/).\nMore information about the creation of this lookup can be found on this\n[blog post about the creation of this library](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2010/08/lookup-for-nicknames-and-diminutive.html)\n\n## Python API\n\nThe Python parser is available on PyPI from\n\n```bash\npip install nicknames\n```\n\nand then you can do:\n\n```python\nfrom nicknames import NickNamer\n\nnn = NickNamer()\n\n# Get the nicknames for a given name as a set of strings\nnicks = nn.nicknames_of(\"Alexander\")\nassert isinstance(nicks, set)\nassert \"al\" in nicks\nassert \"alex\" in nicks\n\n# Note that the relationship isn't symmetric: al is a nickname for alexander,\n# but alexander is not a nickname for al.\nassert \"alexander\" not in nn.nicknames_of(\"al\")\n\n# Capitalization is ignored and leading and trailing whitespace is ignored\nassert nn.nicknames_of(\"alexander\") == nn.nicknames_of(\" ALEXANDER \")\n\n# Queries that aren't found return an empty set\nassert nn.nicknames_of(\"not a name\") == set()\n\n# The other useful thing is to go the other way, nickname to canonical:\n# It acts very similarly to nicknames_of.\ncan = nn.canonicals_of(\"al\")\nassert isinstance(can, set)\nassert \"alexander\" in can\nassert \"alex\" in can\n\nassert \"al\" not in nn.canonicals_of(\"alexander\")\n\n# You can combine these to see if two names are interchangeable:\nunion = nn.nicknames_of(\"al\") | nn.canonicals_of(\"al\")\nare_interchangeable = \"alexander\" in union\n```\n\nFor more advanced usage, such as loading your own data, read the source code.\n",
