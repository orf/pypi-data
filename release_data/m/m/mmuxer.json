Then Mail Muxer is here to save you from this pain !\n\nMail Muxer is a Python tool that will monitor your Inbox, and filter incomming emails according to the given configuration. It was designed to be intuitive and easy to use, by using compact configuration and sensible defaults: a rule can be as simple as\n```yaml\n- condition:\n    FROM: example@email.org\n  move_to: some/folder\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n1. Install:\n\n        pip install mmuxer\n\n2. Create configuration file:\n\n        ```yaml\n        rules:\n          - move_to: receipts\n            condition:\n              ANY:\n                - FROM: some_store@ok.ok\n                - FROM: some_other_store@store.net\n          - move_to: important\n            condition:\n              SUBJECT: important\n          - condition:\n              FROM: spammer@example.com\n            actions:\n              - delete\n\n        settings:\n          server: imap.email.net\n          username: me@email.net\n          password: secret\n        ```\n\n3. Check your configuration:\n\n       mmuxer --config-file config.yaml check\n\n4. Check your folders:\n\n       mmuxer --config-file config.yaml folder compare-destinations\n\n5. Monitor your inbox:\n\n       mmuxer --config-file config.yaml monitor\n\n6. Or apply on all messages of a given IMAP folder:\n\n       mmuxer --config-file config.yaml tidy --folder FOLDER\n\n\n### Note on SSL\n\nIf you get SSL erros while connecting to your server, see the [SSL Configuration](#SSL-Configuration) section.\n\n### Python compatibility\n\nThis program should work with Python >= 3.8.\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Configuration\n\nMail Muxer takes a configuration file as input, that will contain the settings to connect to your IMAP server, and the rules you want to apply.\n\n\nNote that the values in the settings section can also be provided as environemnt variables, or in a `.env` file.\n\n### Conditions\n\n#### Base conditions\n\nThe supported fields for the conditions are `TO`, `FROM` and `SUBJECT`.\n\nThe comporison operators between the value of the email and the provided value are:\n- `CONTAINS`: matches if the email value contains the provided value **(default)**\n- `EQUALS`: matches if the email value is exactly the provided value\n\n#### Composed conditions\n\nIt is also possible to compose conditions with boolean operators: \n - `ALL`: takes as input a list of conditions\n - `ANY`: takes as input a list of conditions\n - `NOT`: takes as input a single condition\n\n#### Example\n\nThe following condition will match emails that are not from `someone@example.com`, and whose subject contains either `keyword1` or `keyword2`:\n\n```yaml\ncondition:\n  ALL:\n    - NOT:\n        FROM: someone@example.com\n        operator: EQUALS\n    - ANY:\n      - SUBJECT: keyword1\n      - SUBJECT: keyword2\n```\n\n### Keep evaluating\n\nBy default, once a rule condition matches an email, evaluation will stop, and sub-sequent rules will not be applied. This can be changed per rule by setting `keep_evaluating` to `true`:\n```yaml\n- condition:\n    FROM: example@email.org\n  move_to: some/folder\n  keep_evaluating: true\n```\n\n### Actions\n\nActions allow to do more than just moving your emails around.\n\nSome common actions are pre-defined, and can be used like so:\n\n```yaml\n- condition:\n    FROM: example@email.org\n  actions:\n   - mark_read  # mark email as read\n   - trash      # move email to Trash folder\n   - delete     # deletes the email ()\n```\n\n\nOther actions are\n\n#### Flag / Unflag\n\nAllow to either set or unset an IMAP flag to a message. Possible flags are:\n- `SEEN`\n- `ANSWERED`\n- `FLAGGED` (often marked as a star in UIs)\n- `DELETED` (will delete the message)\n- `DRAFT`\n\nExamples:\n```yaml\n- condition:\n    FROM: example@email.org\n  actions:\n   - action: flag\n   - flag: SEEN\n```\n\n```yaml\n- condition:\n    FROM: example@email.org\n  actions:\n   - action: unflag\n   - flag: SEEN\n```\n\n#### Pre-configured actions\n\nIt is possible to define actions globally, and re-use them across the rules:\n\n```yaml\nactions:\n  mark_important:\n    action: flag\n    flag: FLAGGED\n\nrules:\n  - condition:\n      FROM: example@email.org\n    actions:\n     - mark_important\n```\n\n### Manage IMAP folder\n\nRun the following to see the available commands:\n\n    mmuxer --config-file config.yaml folder --help\n\nThe `compare-destinations` command ispecially useful, as it will compare the move destinations of your config file with the IMAP folders on your server, and display the differences (allowing you to spot mistakes in your configuration, or missing folders on your server).\n\n### SSL configuration\n\nDepending on the server your are connecting to, you may need specific cipher suite. You can specify it in the settings part of the configuration file:\n\n```\nsettings:\n  ssl_ciphers: DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1  # value that actually works for me\n```\n\nThe value that actually worked for me was `DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1` (I believe the default on most linux distributions is `DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=2`).\n\nSee [the openssl page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/ciphers.html) about cipher suites (this escalated quickly).\n\n\n## What's next\n\nThe current implementation is mostly feature complete for me, but here are some features that could be implemented:\n\n- add a `REGEX` condition operator\n- support more fields for conditions\n- add more actions:\n  - tag emails\n  - forward emails\n  - move destination based on regex match group\n  - automatic folder creation\n  - anything else ?\n- support OAuth / Gmail (I'm not sure how feasible that would be).\n\nDon't hesitate to ask, or make a pull request !\n\n## Credit\n\nThis program relies on\n- the [imap-tools](https://github.com/ikvk/imap_tools) library for everything involving IMAP\n- the mock IMAP server from [aioimaplib](https://github.com/bamthomas/aioimaplib) for it's tests\n- the ever excellent Typer and Pydantic libs\n\nMany thanks to them !\n",
