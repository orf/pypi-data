It uses a character-driven\r\nsocial simulation that forward-simulates the lives of each character, their jobs,\r\nroutines, relationships, and life events. Users can specify custom characters,\r\nresidential/commercial buildings, occupations, life events, social actions, and more.\r\n\r\nCurrently, _Neighborly_ works best as narrative data generator. When the simulation\r\nends, users can save the history of events, characters, relationships, and other stuff.\r\n\r\nNeighborly was inspired by lessons learned from working with\r\n[_Talk of the Town_](https://github.com/james-owen-ryan/talktown)\r\nand aims to give people better documentation, simpler interfaces, and more opportunities\r\nfor extension and content authoring.\r\n\r\n## Core Features\r\n\r\n* Create custom character, buildings, life events, and social actions\r\n* Commandline interface (CLI) tool\r\n* Configure the CLI using YAML text files\r\n* Plugin architecture allows users to modularize and share their custom content\r\n* Export simulation state to JSON for further data processing\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n\r\nBelow are instructions for installing Neighborly and the options one has for using it\r\nin their projects. If you want examples of how to use Neighborly and how to extend it\r\nwith custom content, please refer to\r\n[Neighborly's wiki](https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly/wiki) and the sample scripts\r\nin the [_samples_ directory](https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly/tree/main/samples).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nNeighborly is available to install from PyPI.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install neighborly\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can install it by cloning the main branch of this repo and installing that.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly.git\r\n\r\ncd neighborly\r\n\r\npython -m pip install .\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using as a library\r\n\r\nNeighborly can be used as a library within a Python script or package.\r\nThe `samples` directory contains python scripts that use Neighborly this\r\nway. Please refer to them when creating new Plugins and other content.\r\n\r\n## Running the CLI\r\n\r\nNeighborly can be run as a module `$ python -m neighborly` or commandline `$ neighborly`\r\nscript. If you require additional help while running, please use\r\n`python -m neighborly --help` or `neighborly --help`.\r\n\r\nBy default, Neighborly runs a builtin version of **Talk of the Town**. However, you can\r\nconfigure the simulation settings by creating a `neighborlyconfig.yaml` file in\r\nthe same directory where you're running the CLI. Please refer to the\r\n[wiki](https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly/wiki/Neighborly-CLI) for a list of\r\nvalid configuration settings.\r\n\r\nWhen world generation concludes, Neighborly can write the final simulation data\r\nto a JSON file with the name of the town and the seed used for random number\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n## Running the Samples\r\n\r\nNeighborly provides sample simulations to show users how to customize\r\nit to create new story world themes.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Make sure that you've activated your python virtual environment\r\n# Replace <sample_name>.py with the name of the\r\n# sample you want to run\r\npython ./samples/<sample_name>.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installing for local development\r\n\r\nIf you wish to download a Neighborly for local development, you need to clone/fork this\r\nrepository and install using the _editable_ flag (-e). Please see the instructions\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Step One: Clone Repository\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly.git\r\n\r\n# Step Two (Optional): Create and activate python virtual environment\r\ncd neighborly\r\n\r\n# For Linux and MacOS\r\npython3 -m venv venv\r\nsource ./venv/bin/activate\r\n\r\n# For Windows\r\npython -m venv venv\r\n./venv/Scripts/Activate\r\n\r\n# Step Three: Install local build and dependencies\r\npython -m pip install -e \".\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running the Tests\r\n\r\nThe tests are currently out-of-date and may refer to systems\r\nand logic that no longer exists in Neighborly. The codebase\r\nchanges so frequently that it hasn't been worth the time.\r\nAs modules  become more established, I will add proper tests for them.\r\nFeel free to contribute tests by forking the repo, adding your test(s), and\r\nsubmitting a pull request with a description of your test cases. Your commits\r\nshould only contain changes to files within the `tests` directory. If you\r\nchange any files in other parts of the project, your PR will be rejected.\r\n\r\nPlease follow the steps below to run Neighborly's test suite. Neighborly uses\r\n[PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) to handle unit testing.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Step 1: Install dependencies for tests\r\npython -m pip install -e \".[tests]\"\r\n\r\n# Step 2: Run Pytest\r\npytest\r\n\r\n# Step3 : (Optional) Generate a test coverage report\r\npytest --cov=neighborly tests/\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nNeighborly uses [Numpy-style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)\r\ndocstrings in code and full documentation can be found in the\r\n[Wiki](https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly/wiki).\r\n\r\nWhen adding docstrings for existing or new bits of code please use the following\r\nreferences for how to format your contributions:\r\n\r\n* [Sphinx Napoleon Plugin for processing Numpy Docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html)\r\n* [Example Numpy Style Docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_numpy.html#example-numpy)\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nHere are some ways that people can contribute to Neighborly:\r\n\r\n1. Proposing/Implementing new features\r\n2. Fixing bugs\r\n3. Providing optimizations\r\n4. Fixing typos\r\n5. Filing issues\r\n6. Contributing tutorials/how-tos to the wiki\r\n7. Fixing grammar and spelling in the wiki\r\n8. Creating new samples/plugins\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in contributing to Neighborly, there are multiple ways to get\r\ninvolved, and not all of them require you to be proficient with GitHub. Interested\r\nparties can contribute to the core code base of Neighborly and/or create nre content\r\nin the way of plugins. I love feedback, and if you have any questions, create a new\r\nissue, and I will do my best to answer. If you want to contribute to the core code,\r\nfree to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull-request with a\r\ndescription of your contribution. Please keep in mind that this project is a\r\ntool for creativity and learning. I have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to\r\nencourage healthy collaboration, and will enforce it if I need to.\r\n\r\n## Code Style\r\n\r\nNeighborly uses [_Black_](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to handle code style\r\nand sorts imports using [_isort_](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/). You can follow\r\n[these instructions](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html)\r\nfor setting up both black and isort.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n## Non-Deterministic Behavior\r\n\r\nThe goal of having a seeded pseudo random simulation is so that users experience\r\ndeterministic behavior when using the same starting seed. I try to remove all forms of\r\nnon-determinism, but some slip through. The known areas are listed below. If you find\r\nany, please make a new issue with details of the behavior.\r\n\r\n* Neighborly uses [Tracery](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery) to generate names for\r\ncharacters and locations, and these names may not be consistent despite using the same\r\nrng seed value.\r\n\r\n## DMCA Statement\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a notice alleging copyright infringement, I will take whatever action it\r\ndeems appropriate within its sole discretion, including removal of the allegedly\r\ninfringing materials.\r\n\r\nThe repo image is something fun that I made. I love _The Simpsons_, and I couldn't think\r\nof anyone more neighborly than Ned Flanders. If the copyright owner for _The Simpsons_\r\nwould like me to take it down, please contact me. The same takedown policy applies to\r\nany code samples inspired by TV shows, movies, and games.\r\n",
