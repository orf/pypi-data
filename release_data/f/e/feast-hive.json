            "description": "# Feast Hive Support\n\nHive is not included in current [Feast](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast) roadmap, this project intends to add Hive support for Offline Store.  \nFor more details, can check [this Feast issue](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/issues/1686).\n\n**The public releases have passed all integration tests, please create an issue if you got any problem.**\n\n## Change Logs\n- DONE [v0.1.1] ~~I am working on the first workable version, think it will be released in a couple of days.~~\n- DONE [v0.1.2] ~~Allow custom hive conf when connect to a HiveServer2~~\n- DONE [v0.14.0] ~~Support Feast 0.14.x~~\n- DONE [v0.17.0] ~~Support Feast 0.17.0~~\n- TODO It currently supports `insert into` for uploading entity_df, which is a little inefficient, gonna add extra parameters for people who are able to provide HDFS address in next version (for uploading to HDFS). \n\n## Quickstart\n\n#### Install feast\n\n```shell\npip install feast\n```\n\n#### Install feast-hive\n\n- Install stable version\n\n```shell\npip install feast-hive \n```\n\n- Install develop version (not stable):\n\n```shell\npip install git+https://github.com/baineng/feast-hive.git \n```\n\n#### Create a feature repository\n\n```shell\nfeast init feature_repo\ncd feature_repo\n```\n\n#### Edit `feature_store.yaml`\n\nset `offline_store` type to be `feast_hive.HiveOfflineStore`\n\n```yaml\nproject: ...\nregistry: ...\nprovider: local\noffline_store:\n    type: feast_hive.HiveOfflineStore\n    host: localhost\n    port: 10000        # optional, default is `10000`\n    database: default  # optional, default is `default`\n    hive_conf:         # optional, hive conf overlay\n      hive.join.cache.size: 14797\n      hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions: 779\n    ... # other parameters\nonline_store:\n    ...\n```\n\n#### Create Hive Table\n\n1. Upload `data/driver_stats.parquet` to HDFS\n```shell\nhdfs dfs -copyFromLocal ./data/driver_stats.parquet /tmp/\n```\n2. Create Hive Table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE driver_stats (\n    event_timestamp   bigint,\n    driver_id         bigint,\n    conv_rate         float,\n    acc_rate          float,\n    avg_daily_trips   int,\n    created           bigint\n)\nSTORED AS PARQUET;\n```\n3. Load data into the table\n```sql\nLOAD DATA INPATH '/tmp/driver_stats.parquet' INTO TABLE driver_stats;\n```\n\n#### Edit `example.py`\n\n```python\n# This is an example feature definition file\n\nfrom google.protobuf.duration_pb2 import Duration\n\nfrom feast import Entity, Feature, FeatureView, ValueType\nfrom feast_hive import HiveSource\n\n# Read data from Hive table\n# Here we use a Query to reuse the original parquet data, \n# but you can replace to your own Table or Query.\ndriver_hourly_stats = HiveSource(\n    # table='driver_stats',\n    query = \"\"\"\n    SELECT Timestamp(cast(event_timestamp / 1000000 as bigint)) AS event_timestamp, \n           driver_id, conv_rate, acc_rate, avg_daily_trips, \n           Timestamp(cast(created / 1000000 as bigint)) AS created \n    FROM driver_stats\n    \"\"\",\n    event_timestamp_column=\"event_timestamp\",\n    created_timestamp_column=\"created\",\n)\n\n# Define an entity for the driver.\ndriver = Entity(name=\"driver_id\", value_type=ValueType.INT64, description=\"driver id\", )\n\n# Define FeatureView\ndriver_hourly_stats_view = FeatureView(\n    name=\"driver_hourly_stats\",\n    entities=[\"driver_id\"],\n    ttl=Duration(seconds=86400 * 1),\n    features=[\n        Feature(name=\"conv_rate\", dtype=ValueType.FLOAT),\n        Feature(name=\"acc_rate\", dtype=ValueType.FLOAT),\n        Feature(name=\"avg_daily_trips\", dtype=ValueType.INT64),\n    ],\n    online=True,\n    batch_source=driver_hourly_stats,\n    tags={},\n)\n```\n\n#### Apply the feature definitions\n\n```shell\nfeast apply\n```\n\n#### Generating training data and so on\n\nThe rest are as same as [Feast Quickstart](https://docs.feast.dev/quickstart#generating-training-data)\n\n\n## Developing and Testing\n\n#### Developing\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/baineng/feast-hive.git\ncd feast-hive\n# creating virtual env ...\npip install -e \".[dev]\"\n\n# before commit\nmake format\nmake lint\n```\n\n#### Testing\n\n```shell\npip install -e \".[test]\"\npytest -n 6 --host=localhost --port=10000 --database=default\n```\n\n",
