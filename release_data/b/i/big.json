For years, I've copied-and-pasted all my little\nhelper functions between projects--we've all done it.\nBut now I've finally taken the time to consolidate all those\nuseful little functions into one big package, so they're always\nat hand, ready to use.\nAnd, since it's a public package, you can use 'em too!\n\nNot only that, but I've taken my time and re-thought and\nretooled a lot of these functions.  All the difficult-to-use,\noverspecialized, cheap hacks have been upgraded with elegant\nnew APIs and clever functionality.\n**big** is a real pleasure to use!\n\n**big** requires Python 3.6 or newer.  It has few dependencies.\n\n*Think big!*\n\n## Using big\n\nTo use **big**, just install the **big** package (and its dependencies)\nfrom PyPI using your favorite Python package manager.  Then simply\n\n```Python\nimport big\n```\n\nin your programs.\n\nInternally **big** is broken up into submodules, aggregated together\nloosely by problem domain.  But all functions are also imported into the top-level\nmodule; every function or class published in **big** is available directly in the\n`big` module.\n\n**big** is designed to be safe for use with `import *`:\n\n```Python\nfrom big import *\n```\n\nbut that's up to you.\n\n**big** is licensed using the [MIT license.](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\nYou're free to use it and even ship it in your own programs, as long as you leave my copyright\nnotice on the source code.\n\n#

Restrict the inputs to your functions to values you can\nalways handle, and you won't ever have to return an error.\n\nThe functions in this sub-module are designed to always work.  None of\nthem should ever raise an exception--no matter *what* nonsense you pass in.\n(But don't take that as a challenge!)\n\n\n#### `get_float(o, default=_sentinel)`\n\n> Returns `float(o)`, unless that conversion fails,\n> in which case returns the default value.  If\n> you don't pass in an explicit default value,\n> the default value is `o`.\n\n#### `get_int(o, default=_sentinel)`\n\n> Returns `int(o)`, unless that conversion fails,\n> in which case returns the default value.  If\n> you don't pass in an explicit default value,\n> the default value is `o`.\n\n#### `get_int_or_float(o, default=_sentinel)`\n\n> Converts `o` into a number, preferring an int to a float.\n>\n> If `o` is already an int or float, returns `o` unchanged.  Otherwise,\n> tries `int(o)`.  If that conversion succeeds, returns the result.\n> Otherwise, tries `float(o)`.  If that conversion succeeds, returns\n> the result.  Otherwise returns the default value.

The lines are either\n> strings or bytes objects, depending on the type of `pattern`.  The lines\n> have their newlines stripped but preserve all other whitespace.\n>\n> If `enumerate` is true, returns a list of tuples of (line_number, line).\n> The first line of the file is line number 1.\n>\n> For simplicity of implementation, the entire file is read in to memory\n> at one time.  If `case_insensitive` is True, a lowercased copy is also used.\n\n\n#### `file_mtime(path)`\n\n> Returns the modification time of `path`, in seconds since the epoch.\n> Note that seconds is a float, indicating the sub-second with some\n> precision.\n\n#### `file_mtime_ns(path)`\n\n> Returns the modification time of `path`, in nanoseconds since the epoch.\n\n#### `file_size(path)`\n\n> Returns the size of the file at `path`, as an integer representing the\n> number of bytes.\n\n#### `grep(path, pattern, *, encoding=None, enumerate=False, flags=0)`\n\n> Look for matches to a regular expression pattern in the lines of a file,\n> like the UNIX `grep` utility program.\n>\n> `path` should be an object representing a path to an existing file, one of:\n>\n> * a string,\n> * a bytes object, or\n> * a `pathlib.Path` object.\n>\n> `pattern` should be an object containing a regular expression, one of:\n> * a string,\n> * a bytes object, or\n> * an `re.Pattern`, initialized with either `str` or `bytes`.\n>\n> `encoding` is used as the file encoding when opening the file.\n>\n> if `pattern` uses a `str`, the file is opened in text mode.\n> if `pattern` uses a bytes object, the file is opened in binary mode.\n> `encoding` must be `None` when the file is opened in binary mode.\n>\n> `flags` is passed in as the `flags` argument to `re.compile` if `pattern`\n> is a string or bytes.

This version of `TopologicalSorter` allows modifying the\ngraph at any time, and supports multiple simultaneous *views,* allowing\niteration over the graph more than once.\n\nSee the [**Enhanced `TopologicalSorter`**](#enhanced-topologicalsorter) deep-dive for more information.\n\n#### `CycleError`\n\n> Exception thrown by `TopologicalSorter` when it detects a cycle.\n\n#### `TopologicalSorter(graph=None)`\n\n> An object representing a directed graph of nodes.  See Python's\n> [`graphlib.TopologicalSorter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html#graphlib.TopologicalSorter)\n> for concepts and the basic API.\n\nNew methods on `TopologicalSorter`:\n\n#### `TopologicalSorter.copy()`\n\n> Returns a shallow copy of the graph.

The `heapq` library\n> implements a [binary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap),\n> a data structure used for sorting;\n> you add objects to the heap, and you can then remove\n> objects in sorted order.  Heaps are useful because they have are efficient\n> both in space and in time; they're also inflexible, in that iterating over\n> the sorted items is destructive.\n>\n> Big's `Heap` API mimics the `list` and `collections.deque` objects;\n> this way, all you need to remember is \"it works kinda like a `list` object\".\n> You `append` new items to the heap, then `popleft` them off in sorted order.\n>\n> By default `Heap` creates an empty heap.  If you pass in an iterable `i`\n> to the constructor, this is equivalent to calling the `extend(i)` on the\n> freshly-constructed `Heap`.\n>\n> In addition to the below methods, `Heap` objects support iteration,\n> `len`, the `in` operator, and use as a boolean expression.  You can\n> also index or slice into a `Heap` object, which behaves as if the\n> heap is a list of objects in sorted order.  Getting the first item\n> (`Heap[0]`, aka *peek*) is cheap, the other operations can get very\n> expensive.\n>\n> Methods on a `Heap` object:\n\n\n#### `Heap.append(o)`\n\n> Adds object `o` to the heap.\n\n#### `Heap.clear()`\n\n> Removes all objects from the heap,\n> resetting it to empty.\n\n#### `Heap.copy()`\n\n> Returns a shallow copy of the heap.\n> Only duplicates the heap data structures itself;\n> does not duplicate the objects *in* the heap.\n\n#### `Heap.extend(i)`\n\n> Adds all the objects from the iterable `i` to the heap.\n\n#### `Heap.remove(o)`\n\n> If object `o` is in the heap, removes it.  If `o` is not\n> in the heap, raises `ValueError`.\n\n#### `Heap.popleft()`\n\n> If the heap is not empty, returns the first item in the\n> heap in sorted order.  If the heap is empty, raises `IndexError`.\n\n#### `Heap.append_and_popleft(o)`\n\n> Equivalent to calling `Heap.append(o)` immediately followed\n> by `Heap.popleft()`.  If `o` is smaller than any other object\n> in the heap at the time it's added, this will return `o`.\n\n#### `Heap.popleft_and_append(o)`\n\n> Equivalent to calling `Heap.popleft()` immediately followed\n> by `Heap.append(o)`.  This method will *never* return `o`,\n> unless `o` was already in the heap before the method was called.\n\n#### `Heap.queue`\n\n> Not a method, a property.  Returns a copy of the contents\n> of the heap, in sorted order.\n\n\n## `big.itertools`\n\nFunctions and classes for working with iteration.\nOnly one entry so far.\n\n#### `PushbackIterator(iterable=None)`\n\n> Wraps any iterator, allowing you to push items back on the iterator.\n> This allows you to \"peek\" at the next item (or items); you can get the\n> next item, examine it, and then push it back.  If any objects have\n> been pushed onto the iterator, they are yielded first, before attempting\n> to yield from the wrapped iterator.\n>\n> Pass in any `iterable` to the constructor.  Passing in an `iterable`\n> of `None` means the `PushbackIterator` is created in an exhausted state.\n>\n> When the wrapped `iterable` is exhausted (or if you passed in `None`\n> to the constructor) you can still call push to add new items, at which\n> point the `PushBackIterator` can be iterated over again.\n>\n> In addition to the following methods, `PushbackIterator` supports\n> the iterator protocol and testing for truth.  A `PushbackIterator`\n> is true if iterating over it will yield at least one value.\n\n#### `PushbackIterator.next(default=None)`\n\n> Equivalent to `next(PushbackIterator)`,\n> but won't raise `StopIteration`.\n> If the iterator is exhausted, returns\n> the `default` argument.\n\n#### `PushbackIterator.push(o)`\n\n> Pushes a value into the iterator's internal stack.\n> When a `PushbackIterator` is iterated over, and there are\n> any pushed values, the top value on the stack will be popped\n> and yielded.  `PushbackIterator` only yields from the\n> iterator it wraps when this internal stack is empty.\n\n\n## `big.scheduler`\n\n> A replacement for Python's `sched.scheduler` object,\n> adding full threading support and a modern Python interface.\n>\n> Python's `sched.scheduler` object was a clever idea for the\n> time.  It abstracted away the concept of time from its interface,\n> allowing it to be adapted to new schemes of measuring time--including\n> mock time used for testing.  Very nice!\n>\n> But unfortunately, `sched.scheduler` was designed in 1991--long\n> before multithreading was common, years before threading support\n> was added to Python.  Sadly its API isn't flexible enough to\n> correctly handle some scenarios:\n>\n> * If one thread has called `sched.scheduler.run`,\n>   and the next scheduled event will occur at time **T**,\n>   and a second thread schedules a new event which\n>   occurs at a time < **T**, `sched.scheduler.run` won't\n>   return any events to the first thread until time **T**.\n> * If one thread has called `sched.scheduler.run`,\n>   and the next scheduled event will occur at time **T**,\n>   and a second thread cancels all events,\n>   `sched.scheduler.run` won't exit until time **T**.\n>\n> Also, `sched.scheduler` is thirty years behind the times in\n> Python API design--its design predates many common modern\n> Python conventions.  Its events are callbacks, which it\n> calls directly.  `Scheduler` fixes this: its events are\n> objects, and you iterate over the `Scheduler` object to receive\n> events as they become due.\n>\n> `Scheduler` also benefits from thirty years of improvements\n> to `sched.scheduler`.  In particular, big reimplements the\n> bulk of the `sched.scheduler` test suite, to ensure that\n> `Scheduler` never repeats the historical problems discovered\n> over the lifetime of `sched.scheduler`.\n\n#### `Scheduler(regulator=None)`\n\n> Implements a thread-safe scheduler.  The only argument is the\n> \"regulator\" object to use; the regulator abstracts away all\n> time-related details for the scheduler.  By default `Scheduler`\n> creates a new `Scheduler.Regulator` object and uses that.\n>\n> In addition to the below methods, `Scheduler` objects support\n> being evaluated in a boolean context (they are true if they\n> contain any events), and they support being iterated over.\n> Iterating over a `Scheduler` object blocks until the next\n> event comes due, at which point the `Scheduler` yields that\n> event.  An empty `Scheduler` that is iterated over raises\n> `StopIteration`.  You can reuse `Scheduler` objects, iterating\n> over them until empty, then adding more objects and iterating\n> over them again.\n\n#### `Scheduler.schedule(o, time, *, absolute=False, priority=DEFAULT_PRIORITY)`\n\n> Schedules an object `o` to be yielded as an event by this `schedule` object\n> at some time in the future.\n>\n> By default the `time` value is a relative time value,\n> and is added to the current time; using a `time` value of 0\n> should schedule this event to be yielded immediately.\n>\n> If `absolute` is true, `time` is regarded as an absolute time value.\n>\n> If multiple events are scheduled for the same time, they will\n> be yielded by order of `priority`.  Lowever values of\n> `priority` represent higher priorities.  The default value\n> is `Scheduler.DEFAULT_PRIORITY`, which is 100.  If two events\n> are scheduled for the same time, and have the same priority,\n> `Scheduler` will yield the events in the order they were added.\n>\n> Returns an `Event` object, which can be used to cancel the event.\n\n#### `Scheduler.cancel(event)`\n\n> Cancels a scheduled event.  `event` must be an object\n> returned by this `Scheduler` object.  If `event` is not\n> currently scheduled in this `Scheduler` object,\n> raises `ValueError`.\n\n#### `Scheduler.queue`\n\n> A property, not a method.  Returns a list of the\n> current `Event` objects in the scheduler, in order\n> that they will be yielded.\n\n#### `Scheduler.non_blocking()`\n\n> Returns an iterator for the events in the\n> `Scheduler` that only yields the events that\n> are currently due.  Never blocks; if the next\n> event is not due yet, raises `StopIteration`.\n\n#### `Scheduler.Event(time, priority, sequence, event, scheduler)`\n\n> An object representing a scheduled event in a `Scheduler`.\n> You shouldn't need to create them manually; `Event` objects\n> are created automatically when you add events to a `Scheduler`.\n>\n> Supports one method:\n\n#### `Scheduler.Event.cancel()`\n\n> Cancels this event.  If this event has already been canceled,\n> raises `ValueError`.\n\n#### `Scheduler.Regulator(scheduler)`\n\n> Creates a regulator object for use with a `Scheduler`.\n> Measures time using the `time.monotonic` clock, and\n> sleeps using a `threading.Event` object.\n> Time values are expressed in seconds, either integer\n> or floating point.\n>\n> You can write your own regulator class and use it with\n> `Scheduler`; it must implement the three following methods.\n\n#### `Scheduler.Regulator.now()`\n\n> Returns a \"time value\", an object representing the\n> current time. The object returned must support\n> simple arithmetic operations (`+` and `-`) and\n> rich comparison with other time values.\n\n#### `Scheduler.Regulator.sleep(t)`\n\n> Sleeps for a period of time expressed as a\n> relative \"time value\".  Note that `sleep` must\n> be interruptable with the `wake` method.\n\n#### `Scheduler.Regulator.wake()`\n\n> Wakes up *all* threads that are current sleeping\n> using `Scheduler.Regulator.sleep(t)`.  All calls\n> to `sleep` on this `Regulator` object must return\n> immediately.\n\n## `big.text`\n\n> Functions for working with text strings.  There are\n> several families of functions inside the `text` module;\n> for a higher-level view of those families, read the\n> following deep-dives:\n>\n> * [**The `multi-` family of functions**](#The-multi--family-of-functions)\n> * [**`lines` and lines modifier functions**](#lines-and-lines-modifier-functions)\n> * [**Word wrapping and formatting**](#word-wrapping-and-formatting)\n>\n> All the functions in `big.text` will work with either\n> `str` or `bytes` objects, except the three\n> [**Word wrapping and formatting**](#word-wrapping-and-formatting)\n> functions.

These functions\nare well-designed, and often do what you want.  But they're\nall surprisingly opinionated.  And... what if your use case\ndoesn't fit exactly into their narrow viewpoints?  `str.strip`\nsupports two distinct modes of operation; if you want\nto split your string in a third, slightly different way, you\nprobably just can't use `str.strip`.\nSo what *can* you use?  There's `re.strip`, but it can be\nhard to use.  Now there's a new answer:\n[`multisplit`.](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\n\nThe goal of\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nis to be the be-all end-all text\nsplitting function.  You pass in the string you want to split,\nand an iterable containing the separator strings you want to\nsplit on.  It returns an iterator yielding the split strings.\nIt's designed to replace every mode of operation for\n`str.split`, `str.rstrip`, and `str.splitlines`, and it\ncan even be used to replace `str.partition` and `str.rpartition`\ntoo.\n\nThe cornerstone of [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nis the `separators` argument.\nThis is an iterable of strings, of the same type (`str` or `bytes`)\nas the string you want to split (`s`).  `multisplit` will split\nthe string at *each* non-overlapping instance of any string\nspecified in `separators`.\n\nBut\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nalso let you fine-tune how it splits, through five keyword-only\nparameters:\n\n* `keep` lets you include the separator strings in the output,\n  in a number of different formats.\n* `separate` lets you specify whether adjacent separator strings\n  should be grouped together (like `str.strip` operating on\n  whitespace) or regarded as separate (like `str.strip` when\n  you pass in an explicit `sep` separator).\n* `strip` lets you strip separator strings from the beginning,\n  end, or both ends of the string you're splitting.\n* `maxsplit` lets you specify the maximum number of times to\n  split the string (like the `maxsplit` argument to `str.strip`).\n* `reverse` lets you apply `maxsplit` to the end of the string\n  and splitting backwards (like using `str.rstrip` instead of\n  `str.strip`).\n\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nalso inspired [`multistrip`](#multistrips-separators-leftTrue-rightTrue)\n and [`multipartition`,](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)\nwhich also take this same `separators` arguments.  There are\nother **big** functions that take a `separators` argument, and the\nparameter name always has the word `separators` in it.\n(For example, `comment_separators` for `lines_filter_comment_lines`.)\n\nThe downside of [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nis that, since it *is* so\nsophisticated and tunable, it can be hard to use.  It takes\n*five keyword-only parameters* after all.  However, these\nare designed to be reasonably memorable, and they all default\nto `False` (except `strip`).  But the best way to combat the\ncomplexity of calling\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nis to use it as a building block\nfor your own, presumably easier-to-use, text splitting functions.\nFor example,\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nis used to implement [`multipartition`,](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)\n`normalize_whitespace`,  and [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs),\nand several others.\n\n### Why do you sometimes get empty strings when you split?\n\nSometimes when you split using\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE),\nyou'll get empty strings in the return value.  This might be unexpected,\nviolating the [Principle Of Least Astonishment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)\nBut there are excellent reasons for this behavior, and it stems from observing\nhow `str.split` behaves.\n\n`str.split` really has two\nmajor modes of operation: when you don't pass in a separator (or pass in `None` for the\nseparator), and when you pass in an explicit separator string.  In this latter mode,\nthe documentation says it regards every instance of a separator string as an individual\nseparator splitting the string.  What does that mean?  Watch what happens when you have\ntwo adjacent separators in the string you're splitting:\n\n    >>> '1,2,,3'.split(',')\n    ['1', '2', '', '3']\n\nWhat's that empty string doing between `'2'` and `'3'`?  Here's how to think about it:\nwhen you pass in an explicit separator, `str.split` splits at *every* occurance of that\nseparator in the string.  It *always* splits the string into two places, whenever there's\na separator.  And when there are two adjacent separators, conceptually, they have a\nzero-length string in between them:\n\n    >>> '1,2,,3'[4:4]\n    ''\n\nThe empty string in the output of `str.split` represents the fact that there\nwere two adjacent separators.  If `str.split` didn't add that empty string,\nand the output looked like this:\n\n    ['1', '2', '3']\n\nit'd be indistinguishable from splitting the same string but *without*\ntwo separators in a row:\n\n    >>> '1,2,3'.split(',')\n    ['1', '2', '3']\n\nThis difference is crucial when you want to reconstruct the original string from\nthe split list.  `str.join` should always be the inverse of `str.split`, and with\nthat empty string there, it works correctly:\n\n    >>> ','.join(['1', '2', '3'])\n    '1,2,3'\n    >>> ','.join(['1', '2', '', '3'])\n    '1,2,,3'\n\nNow take a look at what happens when the string\nyou're splitting starts or ends with a separator:\n\n    >>> ',1,2,3,'.split(',')\n    ['', '1', '2', '3', '']\n\nThis might seem weird.  But, just like with two adjacent separators,\nthis behavior is important for consistency.  Conceptually there's\na zero-length string between the beginning of the string and the first\ncomma.  And `str.join` needs those empty strings in order to correctly\nrecreate the original string.\n\n    >>> ','.join(['', '1', '2', '3', ''])\n    ',1,2,3,'\n\nNaturally,\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nduplicates this behavior.  When you want\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nto emulate the behavior of `str.split` when using an explicit separator\nstring, just pass in `keep=False`, `separate=True`, and `strip=False`.  That is, if 'a' and 'b' are strings,\n\n     big.multisplit(a, (b,), keep=False, separate=True, strip=False)\n\nproduces the same output as\n\n     a.split(b)\n\nHere's sample code using\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\nto split the strings we've been playing with:\n\n    >>> list(big.multisplit('1,2,,3', (',',), keep=False, separate=True, strip=False))\n    ['1', '2', '', '3']\n    >>> list(big.multisplit(',1,2,3,', (',',), keep=False, separate=True, strip=False))\n    ['', '1', '2', '3', '']\n\nThis \"emit an empty string\" behavior has ramifications for the other `keep` modes, too.\nThe behavior of `keep=True` is perhaps easy to predict; we just append the separators\nto the previous string segment:\n\n    >>> list(big.multisplit('1,2,,3', (',',), keep=True, separate=True, strip=False))\n    ['1,', '2,', ',', '3']\n    >>> list(big.multisplit(',1,2,3,', (',',), keep=True, separate=True, strip=False))\n    [',', '1,', '2,', '3,', '']\n\nThe principle here is that, when you use `keep=True`, you should be able to reconstitute\nthe original string with `''.join`:\n\n    >>> ''.join(['1,', '2,', ',', '3'])\n    '1,2,,3'\n    >>> ''.join([',', '1,', '2,', '3,', ''])\n    ',1,2,3,''\n\n`keep=big.ALTERNATING` is much the same, except we insert the separators as their\nown segments, rather than appending each one to the previous segment:\n\n    >>> list(big.multisplit('1,2,,3', (',',), keep=big.ALTERNATING, separate=True, strip=False))\n    ['1', ',', '2', ',', '', ',', '3']\n    >>> list(big.multisplit(',1,2,3,', (',',), keep=big.ALTERNATING, separate=True, strip=False))\n    ['', ',', '1', ',', '2', ',', '3', ',', '']\n\nAnd, as with `keep=True`, you can also recreate the original string by passing\nthese arrays in to `''.join`:\n\n    >>> ''.join(['1', ',', '2', ',', '', ',', '3'])\n    '1,2,,3'\n    >>> ''.join(['', ',', '1', ',', '2', ',', '3', ',', ''])\n    ',1,2,3,''\n\nFinally, consider `keep=big.AS_PAIRS`.  The behavior here seemed so strange,\ninitially I thought it was wrong.  But I gave it a lot of thought and convinced\nmyself that, yes, this is correct:\n\n    >>> list(big.multisplit('1,2,,3', (',',), keep=big.AS_PAIRS, separate=True, strip=False))\n    [('1', ','), ('2', ','), ('', ','), ('3', '')]\n    >>> list(big.multisplit(',1,2,3,', (',',), keep=big.AS_PAIRS, separate=True, strip=False))\n    [('', ','), ('1', ','), ('2', ','), ('3', ','), ('', '')]\n\nThat tuple at the end, just containing two empty strings:\n\n    ('', '')\n\nis so strange.  How can that be right?\n\nIt's the same as `str.split`.\n[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)\n*must* split the string into two pieces *every* time it finds the separator\nin the original string.  So it *must* emit the empty non-separator string.\nAnd since that zero-length string isn't (cannot!) be followed by a separator,\nwhen using `keep=AS_PAIRS` the final separator string is *also* empty.\n\nYou can recreate the original string from this result too,\nalthough you have to unpack the tuples:\n\n    >>> ''.join(s  for t in [('1', ','), ('2', ','), ('', ','), ('3', '')]  for s in t)\n    '1,2,,3'\n    >>> ''.join(s  for t in [('', ','), ('1', ','), ('2', ','), ('3', ','), ('', '')]  for s in t)\n    ',1,2,3,'\n\n\n## `lines` and lines modifier functions\n\n[`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs) creates an iterator that yields individual lines\nsplit from a string.  It's designed to make it easy to write\nwell-behaved simple text parsers.\n\nFor example, every yielded line is accompanied by a `LinesInfo`\nobject which provides the line number and starting column number\nfor each line.  This makes it easy for your parser to provide\nline and column information for error messages.\n\nThe output of [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs) can be modified by \"lines modifier\"\nfunctions.  These are functions that iterate over a lines\niterator and re-yield the values, possibly modifying or\ndiscarding them along the way.  For example, passing\na [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs) iterator into `lines_filter_empty_lines` results\nin an iterator that skips over the empty lines.\nAll the lines modifier functions that ship with big\nstart with the string `lines_`.\n\nActually there are additional constraints on the names\nof lines modifier functions.  The second word of the name\nof the function, immediately after `lines_`, tells you what\nthe function will do.  Some examples:\n\n* `filter` means this lines modifier may remove some\n  lines from the output.  `lines_filter_empty_lines`\n  will only yield a line if it isn't empty.\n* `strip` means this lines modifier may remove one or\n  more substrings from the line.  A lines modifier that\n  removes the initial part of a line will add a\n  `leading` field to the accompanying `LineInfo` object\n  containing the substring removed from the beginning\n  of the line, and will also update the `column_number`\n  of the line to reflect the change to the line.\n* `convert` means this lines modifier may change one\n  or more substrings in the line.\n\nAll lines modifier functions are composable with each\nother; you can \"stack\" them together simply by passing\nthe output of one into the input of another.  For example,\n\n     with open(\"textfile.txt\", \"rt\") as f:\n         for info, lines in big.lines_filter_empty_lines(\n     \t     big.lines_rstrip(lines(f.read()))):\n     \t     ...\n\nwill iterate over the lines of `textfile.txt`, skipping\nover all empty lines and lines that consist only of\nwhitespace.\n\nWhen you stack line modifiers in this way, note that the\n*outer* modifiers happen *later*.  In the above example,\neach line is first \"r-stripped\", and then discarded\nif it is empty.  If you stacked the line modifiers in\nthe opposite order:\n\n     with open(\"textfile.txt\", \"rt\") as f:\n         for info, lines in big.lines_rstrip(\n     \t     big.lines_filter_empty_lines(lines(f.read()))):\n     \t     ...\n\nthen you would filter out empty lines first, and *then*\n\"r-strip\" the lines.  So lines in the input that contained\nonly whitespace would still get yielded as empty lines,\nwhich in this case is probably not what you wanted.\n\nOf course, you can write your own lines modifier functions!\nSimply accept a lines iterator as an argument, iterate over\nit, and yield each line info and line, modifying them\n(or not yielding them!) as you see fit.  You can potentially\neven write your own lines iterator, a replacement for [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs),\nif you need functionality [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs) doesn't provide.\n\n## Word wrapping and formatting\n\n**big** contains three functions used to reflow and format text\nin a pleasing manner.  In the order you should use them, they are\n[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue),\n`word_wrap`,\nand optionally\n[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0).\nThis trio of functions gives you the following word-wrap superpowers:\n\n* Paragraphs of text representing embedded \"code\" don't get word-wrapped.\n  Instead, their formatting is preserved.\n* Multiple texts can be merged together into multiple columns.\n\n#### Split text array\n\n[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)\nsplits a string of text into a *split text array*,\nand `word_wrap` consumes a *split text array* to produce its\nword-wrapped output.  A split text array is an array of strings.\nYou'll see four kinds of strings in a split text array:\n\n* Individual words, ready to be word-wrapped.\n* Entire lines of \"code\", preserving their formatting.\n* Line breaks, represented by a single newline: `'\\n'`.\n* Paragraph breaks, represented by two newlines: `'\\n\\n'`.\n\nWhen\n[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)\nsplits a string, it views each\nline as either a \"text\" line or a \"code\" line.  Any non-blank\nline that starts with `code_indent` or more spaces (or the\nequivalent using tabs) is a \"code\" line, and any other\nnon-blank line is a \"text\" line.  But it has some state\nhere; when\n[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)\nsees a \"text\" line,\nit switches into \"text\" mode, and when it sees a \"code\"\nline it switches into \"code\" mode.\n\nIn \"text\" mode:\n\n* words are separated by whitespace,\n* initial whitespace on the line is discarded,\n* the amount of whitespace between words is irrelevant,\n* individual newline characters are ignored, and\n* more than two newline characters are converted into exactly\n  two newlines (aka a \"paragraph break\").\n\nIn \"code\" mode:\n\n* all whitespace is preserved, except for trailing whitespace on a line, and\n* all newline characters are preserved.\n\nAlso, whenever\n[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)\nswitches between\n\"text\" and \"code\" mode, it emits a paragraph break.\n\nThis might be clearer with an example or two.  The following text:\n\n```\nhello there!\nthis is text.\n\n\nthis is a second paragraph!\n```\n\nwould be represented in a Python string as:\n```Python\n\"hello there!\\nthis is text.\\n\\n\\nthis is a second paragraph!\"\n```\n\nNote the three newlines between the second and third lines.\n\n[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)\nwould turn this into the following split text array:\n```Python\n[ 'hello', 'there!', 'this', 'is', 'text.', '\\n\\n',\n  'this', 'is', 'a', 'second', 'paragraph!']\n```\n\n[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)\nmerged the first two lines together into\na single paragraph, and collapsed the three newlines separating\nthe two paragraphs into a \"paragraph break\" marker\n(two newlines in one string).\n\nAnd this text:\n\n```\nWhat are the first four squared numbers?\n\n    for i in range(1, 5):\n\n\n        print(i**2)\n\nPython is just that easy!\n```\n\nwould be represented in a Python string as (broken up into multiple strings for clarity):\n```Python\n\"What are the first four squared numbers?\\n\\n\"\n+\n\"    for i in range(1, 5):\\n\\n\\n\"\n+\n\"        print(i**2)\\n\\nPython is just that easy!\"\n```\n\n[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)\nconsiders the two lines with initial whitespace as \"code\" lines,\nand so the text is split into the following split text array:\n```Python\n['What', 'are', 'the', 'first', 'four', 'squared', 'numbers?', '\\n\\n',\n  '    for i in range(1, 5):', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '        print(i**2)', '\\n\\n',\n  'Python', 'is', 'just', 'that', 'easy!']\n```\n\nHere we have a text paragraph, followed by a \"code paragraph\", followed\nby a second text paragraph.  The code paragraph preserves the internal\nnewlines, though they are represented as individual \"line break\" markers\n(strings containing a single newline).  Every paragraph is separated by\na \"paragraph marker\".\n\nHere's a simple algorithm for joining a split text array back into a\nsingle string:\n```Python\n\nprev = None\na = []\nfor word in split_text_array:\n    if not (prev and prev.isspace() and word.isspace()):\n        a.append(' ')\n    a.append(word)\ntext = \"\".join(a)\n```\n\nOf course, this algorithm is too simple to do word wrapping.\nNor does it handle adding two spaces after sentence-ending\npunctuation.  In practice you should just use\n[`wrap_words`](#wrap_wordswords-margin79--two_spacestrue).\n\n#### Merging columns\n\n[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)\nmerges multiple strings into columns on the same line.\n\nFor example, it could merge these three Python strings:\n```Python\n[\n\"Here's the first\\ncolumn of text.\",\n\"More text over here!\\nIt's the second\\ncolumn!  How\\nexciting!\",\n\"And here's a\\nthird column.\",\n]\n```\n\ninto the following text:\n\n```\nHere's the first    More text over here!   And here's a\ncolumn of text.     It's the second        third column.\n                    column!  How\n                    exciting!\n```\n\n(Note that\n[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)\ndoesn't do its own word-wrapping;\ninstead, it's designed to consume the output of\n[`wrap_words`](#wrap_wordswords-margin79--two_spacestrue).)\n\nEach column is passed in to\n[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)\nas a \"column tuple\":\n\n```Python\n(s, min_width, max_width)\n```\n\n`s` is the string,\n`min_width` is the minimum width of the column, and\n`max_width` is the minimum width of the column.\n\nAs you saw above, `s` can contain newline characters,\nand\n[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)\nobeys those when formatting each column.\n\nFor each column,\n[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)\nmeasures the longest\nline of each column.  The width of the column is determined\nas follows:\n\n- If the longest line is less than `min_width` characters long,\n  the column will be `min_width` characters wide.\n- If the longest line is less than or equal to `min_width`\n  characters long, and less than or equal to `max_width`\n  characters long, the column will be as wide as the longest line.\n- If the longest line is greater than `max_width` characters long,\n  the column will be `max_width` characters wide, and lines that\n  are longer than `max_width` characters will \"overflow\".\n\n#### Overflow\n\nWhat is \"overflow\"?  It's when the text in a column is wider than that\ncolumn's `max_width`.\n[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)\ndiscusses both \"overflow lines\",\nlines that are longer than `max_width`, and \"overflow columns\", which\nare columns that contain any overflow lines.\n\nWhat does\n[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)\ndo when it encounters overflow?  It provides\nthree \"strategies\" to deal with this condition, and you can control\nwhich it uses through the `overflow_strategy` parameter.  The three are:\n\n`OverflowStrategy.RAISE`: Raise an `OverflowError` exception.  The default.\n\n`OverflowStrategy.INTRUDE_ALL`: Intrude into all subsequent columns on\nall lines where the overflowed column is wider than its max_width.\nThe subsequent columns \"make space\" for the overflow text by pausing their\noutput on the overflow lines.\n\n`OverflowStrategy.DELAY_ALL`:  Delay all columns after the overflowed\ncolumn, not beginning any until after the last overflowed line\nin the overflowed column.  This is like `INTRUDE_ALL`, except that\nthey \"make space\" by pausing their output until the last overflowed\nline.\n\nWhen `overflow_strategy` is `INTRUDE_ALL` or `DELAY_ALL`, and\neither `overflow_before` or `overflow_after` is nonzero, these\nspecify the number of extra lines before or after\nthe overflowed lines in a column where the subsequent columns\n\"pause\".\n\n\n## Enhanced `TopologicalSorter`\n\n#### Overview\n\n**big**'s [`TopologicalSorter`](#topologicalsortergraphnone)\nis a drop-in replacement for\n[`graphlib.TopologicalSorter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html#graphlib.TopologicalSorter)\nin the Python standard library (new in 3.9).\nHowever, the version in **big** has been greatly upgraded:\n\n- `prepare` is now optional, though it still performs a cycle check.\n- You can add nodes and edges to a graph at any time, even while\n  iterating over the graph.  Adding nodes and edges always succeeds.\n- You can remove nodes from graph `g` with the new method `g.remove(node)`.\n  Again, you can do this at any time, even while iterating over the graph.\n  Removing a node from the graph always succeeds, assuming the node is in the graph.\n- The functionality for iterating over a graph now lives in its own object called\n  a *view*.  View objects implement the `get_ready`, `done`, and `__bool__`\n  methods.  There's a default view built in to the graph object;\n  the `get_ready`, `done`, and `__bool__` methods on a graph just call\n  into the graph's default view.  You can create a new view at any time\n  by calling the new `view` method.\n\nNote that if you're using a view to iterate over the graph, and you modify the graph,\nand the view now represents a state that isn't *coherent* with the graph,\nattempting to use that view raises a `RuntimeError`.  More on what I mean\nby \"coherence\" in a minute.\n\nThis implementation also fixes some minor warts with the existing API:\n\n- In Python's implementation, `static_order` and `get_ready`/`done` are mutually exclusive.  If you ever call\n  `get_ready` on a graph,  you can never call `static_order`, and vice-versa.  The implementaiton in **big**\n  doesn't have this restriction, because its implementation of `static_order` creates and uses a new view object\n  every time it's called..\n- In Python's implementation, you can only iterate over the graph once, or call `static_order` once.\n  The implementation in **big** solves this in several ways: it allows you to create as many views as you\n  want, and you can call the new `reset` method on a view to reset it to its initial state.\n\n#### Graph / view coherence\n\nSo what does it mean for a view to no longer be coherent with the graph?\nConsider the following code:\n\n```Python\ng = big.TopologicalSorter()\ng.add('B', 'A')\ng.add('C', 'A')\ng.add('D', 'B', 'C')\ng.add('B', 'A')\nv = g.view()\ng.ready() # returns ('A',)\ng.add('A', 'Q')\n```\n\nFirst this code creates a graph `g` with a classic \"diamond\"\ndependency pattern.  Then it creates a new view `v`, and gets\nthe currently \"ready\" nodes, which consists just of the node\n`'A'`.  Finally it adds a new dependency: `'A'` depends on `'Q'`.\n\nAt this moment, view `v` is no longer _coherent._  `'A'` has been\nmarked as \"ready\", but `'Q'` has not.  And yet `'A'` depends on `'Q'`.\nAll those statements can't be true at the same time!\nSo view `v` is no longer _coherent,_  and any attempt to interact\nwith `v` raises an exception.\n\nTo state it more precisely: if view `v` is a view on graph `g`,\nand you call `g.add('Z', 'Y')`,\nand neither of these statements is true in view `v`:\n\n- `'Y'` has been marked as `done`.\n- `'Z'` has not yet been yielded by `get_ready`.\n\nthen `v` is no longer \"coherent\".\n\n(If `'Y'` has been marked as `done`, then it's okay to make `'Z'` dependent on\n`'Y'` regardless of what state `'Z'` is in.  Likewise, if `'Z'` hasn't been yielded\nby `get_ready` yet, then it's okay to make `'Z'` dependent on `'Y'` regardless\nof what state `'Y'` is in.)\n\nNote that you can restore a view to coherence.  In this case,\nremoving either `Y` or `Z` from `g` would resolve the incoherence\nbetween `v` and `g`, and `v` would start working again.\n\nAlso note that you can have multiple views, in various states of iteration,\nand by modifying the graph you may cause some to become incoherent but not\nothers.  Views are completely independent from each other.\n\n\n## Bound inner classes\n\n#### Overview\n\nOne minor complaint I have about Python is about inner classes.\nAn \"inner class\" is a class defined inside another class.  And,\nwell, inner classes seem kind of half-baked.   Unlike methods,\ninner classes don't get bound to the object.\n\nConsider this Python code:\n\n```Python\nclass Outer(object):\n    def method(self):\n        pass\n    class Inner(object):\n        def __init__(self):\n            pass\n\no = Outer()\no.method()\ni = o.Inner()\n```\n\nWhen `o.method` is called, Python automatically passes in the `o` object as the first parameter\n(generally called `self`).  In object-oriented lingo, `o` is *bound* to `method`, and indeed\nPython calls this object a *bound method*:\n\n\n    >>> o.method\n    <bound method Outer.method of <__main__.Outer object at 0x########>>\n\nBut that doesn't happen when `o.Inner` is called.  (It *does* pass in\na `self`, but in this case it's the newly-created `Inner` object.)\nThere's just no built-in way for the `o.Inner` object being constructed\nto *automatically* get a reference to `o`.  If you need one, you must\nexplicitly pass one in, like so:\n\n```Python\nclass Outer(object):\n    def method(self):\n        pass\n    class Inner(object):\n        def __init__(self, outer):\n            self.outer = outer\n\no = Outer()\no.method()\ni = o.Inner(o)\n```\n\nThis seems redundant.  You don't have to pass in `o` explicitly to method calls,\nwhy should you have to pass it in explicitly to inner classes?\n\nWell--now you don't have to!\nYou just need to decorate the inner class with `@big.BoundInnerClass`.\n\n#### Using bound inner classes\n\nLet's modify the above example to use our [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)\ndecorator:\n\n```Python\nfrom big import BoundInnerClass\n\nclass Outer(object):\n    def method(self):\n        pass\n\n    @BoundInnerClass\n    class Inner(object):\n        def __init__(self, outer):\n            self.outer = outer\n\no = Outer()\no.method()\ni = o.Inner()\n```\n\nNotice that `Inner.__init__` now accepts an `outer` parameter,\neven though you didn't pass in any arguments to `o.Inner`.\nAnd when it's called, `o` is magically passed in to `outer`!\nThanks, [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)!  You've saved the day.\n\nDecorating an inner class like this always adds a second positional\nparameter, after `self`.  And, like `self`, in theory you don't have\nto use the name `outer`.  (Although for consistency's sakes, it's probably\na good idea.)\n\n#### Inheritance\n\nBound inner classes get slightly complicated when mixed with inheritance.\nIt's not all that difficult, you merely need to obey the following rules:\n\n1. *A bound inner class can inherit normally from any unbound class.*\n\n2. *To subclass from a bound inner class while still inside the outer\nclass scope, or when referencing the inner class from the outer class\n(as opposed to an instance of the outer class), you must actually\nsubclass or reference `classname.cls`.*  This is because inside the\nouter class, the \"class\" you see is actually an instance of a\n[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls) object.\n\n3. *All classes that inherit from a bound inner class must always call the\nsuperclass's `__init__`. You don't need to pass in the outer parameter;\nit'll be automatically passed in to the superclass's `__init__` as before.*\n\n4. *An inner class that inherits from a bound inner class, and which also wants\nto be bound to the outer object, should be decorated with\n[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls).*\n\n5. *An inner class that inherits from a bound inner class, but doesn't want\nto be bound to the outer object, should be decorated with\n[`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls).*\n\nRestating the last two rules: every class that descends from any\n[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)\nshould be decorated with either\n[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)\nor\n[`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls).\n\nHere's a simple example using inheritance with bound inner classes:\n\n```Python\nfrom big import BoundInnerClass, UnboundInnerClass\n\nclass Outer(object):\n\n    @BoundInnerClass\n    class Inner(object):\n        def __init__(self, outer):\n            self.outer = outer\n\n    @UnboundInnerClass\n    class ChildOfInner(Inner.cls):\n        def __init__(self):\n            super(Outer.ChildOfInner, self).__init__()\n\no = Outer()\ni = o.ChildOfInner()\n```\n\nWe followed the rules:\n\n* `Inner` inherits from object; since object isn't a bound inner class,\n  there are no special rules about inheritance `Inner` needs to obey.\n* `ChildOfInner` inherits from `Inner.cls`, not `Inner`.\n* Since `ChildOfInner` inherits from a\n  [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls),\n  it must be\n  decorated with either [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)\n  or [`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls).\n  It doesn't want the outer object passed in, so it's decorated\n  with [`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls).\n* `ChildOfInner.__init__` calls `super().__init__`.\n\nNote that, because `ChildOfInner` is decorated with\n[`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls),\nit doesn't take an `outer` parameter.  Nor does it pass in an `outer`\nargument when it calls `super().__init__`.  But when the constructor for\n`Inner` is called, the correct `outer` parameter is passed in--like magic!\nThanks again, [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)!\n\nIf you wanted `ChildOfInner` to also get the outer argument passed in to\nits `__init__`, just decorate it with [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)\ninstead of\n[`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls),\nlike so:\n\n```Python\nfrom big import BoundInnerClass\n\nclass Outer(object):\n\n    @BoundInnerClass\n    class Inner(object):\n        def __init__(self, outer):\n            self.outer = outer\n\n    @BoundInnerClass\n    class ChildOfInner(Inner.cls):\n        def __init__(self, outer):\n            super(Outer.ChildOfInner, self).__init__()\n            assert self.outer == outer\n\no = Outer()\ni = o.ChildOfInner()\n```\n\nAgain, `ChildOfInner.__init__` doesn't need to explicitly\npass in `outer` when calling `super.__init__`.\n\nYou can see more complex examples of using inheritance with\n[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)\n(and [`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls))\nin the **big** test suite.\n\n#### Miscellaneous notes\n\n* If you refer to a bound inner class directly from the outer class,\n  rather than using the outer instance, you get the original class.\n  This means that references to `Outer.Inner` are consistent, and it's\n  a base class of all the bound inner classes. This also means that if\n  you attempt to construct one without using an outer instance, you must\n  pass in the outer parameter by hand, just as you would have to pass\n  in the self parameter by hand when calling an unbound method.\n\n* If you refer to a bound inner class from an outer instance,\n  you get a subclass of the original class.\n\n* Bound classes are cached in the outer object, which both provides\n  a small speedup and ensures that `isinstance` relationships are\n  consistent.\n\n* You must not rename inner classes decorated with either\n  [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)\n  or [`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls)!\n  The implementation of\n  [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)\n  looks up\n  the bound inner class in the outer object by name in several places.\n  Adding aliases to bound inner classes is harmless, but the original\n  attribute name must always work.\n\n* Bound inner classes from different objects are different classes.\n  This is symmetric with bound methods; if you have two objects\n  `a` and `b` that are instances of the same class,\n  `a.BoundInnerClass != b.BoundInnerClass`, just as `a.method != b.method`.\n\n* The binding only goes one level deep; if you had an inner class `C`\n  inside another inner class `B` inside a class `A`, the constructor\n  for `C` would be called with the `B` object, not the `A` object.\n\n* Similarly, if you have a bound inner class `B` inside a class `A`,\n  and another bound inner class `D` inside a class `C`, and `D`\n  inherits from `B`, the constructor for `D` will be called with\n  the `B` object but not the `A` object. When `D` calls `super().__init__`\n  it'll have to fill in the `outer` parameter by hand.\n\n* There's a race condition in the implementation: if you access a\n  bound inner class through an outer instance from two separate threads,\n  and the bound inner class was not previously cached, the two threads\n  may get different (but equivalent) bound inner class objects, and only\n  one of those instances will get cached on the outer object.  This could\n  lead to confusion and possibly cause bugs. For example, you could have\n  two objects that would be considered equal if they were instances of\n  the same bound inner class, but would not be considered equal if\n  instantiated by different instances of that same bound inner class.\n  There's an easy workaround for this problem: access the bound inner\n  class from the `__init__` of the outer class, which should allow\n  the code to cache the bound inner class instance before a second\n  thread could ever get a reference to the outer object.\n\n## Release history\n\n**0.6.8**\n\n* Renamed two of the three freshly-added lines modifier functions:\n  `lines_filter_contains` is now \n  [`lines_containing`](#lines_containingli-s--invertfalse),\n  and `lines_filter_grep` is now\n  [`lines_grep`](#lines_grepli-pattern--invertfalse-flags0).\n\n**0.6.7**\n\n* Added three new lines modifier functions\n  to the [`text`](#bigtext) module:\n  `lines_filter_contains`,\n  `lines_filter_grep`,\n  and\n  [`lines_sort`](#lines_sortli--reversefalse).\n* [`gently_title`](#gently_titles-apostrophesnone-double_quotesnone)\n  now accepts `str` or `bytes`.  Also added the `apostrophes` and\n  `double_quotes` arguments.\n\n**0.6.6**\n\n* Fixed a bug in\n  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE).\n  I thought when using `keep=AS_PAIRS` that it shouldn't ever emit a 2-tuple\n  containing just empty strings--but on further reflection I've realized that\n  that's correct.  This behavior is now tested and documented, along with\n  the reasoning behind it.\n* Added the `reverse` flag to\n  [`re_partition`](#re_partitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0-reversefalse).\n* `whitespace_without_dos` and `newlines_without_dos` still had the DOS\n  end-of-line sequence in them!  Oops!\n    * Added a unit test to check that.  The unit test also ensures that\n      `whitespace`, `newlines`, and all the variants (`utf8_`, `ascii_`,\n      and `_with_dos`) exactly match the set of characters Python considers\n      whitespace and newline characters.\n* Lots more documentation and formatting fixes.\n\n**0.6.5**\n\n* Added the new [`itertools`](#bigitertools) module, which so far only contains\n  [`PushbackIterator`](#pushbackiteratoriterablenone).\n* Added\n  [`lines_strip_comments`](#lines_strip_commentsli-comment_separators--quotes--backslash-rstriptrue-triple_quotestrue)\n  and\n  [`split_quoted_strings`](#split_quoted_stringss-quotes---triple_quotestrue-backslash)\n  to the\n  [`text`](#bigtext)\n  module.\n\n**0.6.1**\n\n* I realized that [`whitespace`](#whitespace) should contain the DOS end-of-line\n  sequence (`'\\r\\n'`), as it should be considered a single separator\n  when splitting etc.  I added that, along with [`whitespace_no_dos`](#whitespace),\n  and naturally [`utf8_whitespace_no_dos`](#whitespace) and\n  [`ascii_whitespace_no_dos`](#whitespace) too.\n* Minor doc fixes.\n\n**0.6**\n\nA **big** upgrade!\n\n* Completely retooled and upgraded\n  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE),\n  and added\n  [`multistrip`](#multistrips-separators-leftTrue-rightTrue)\n  and\n  [`multipartition`,](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)\n  collectively called\n  [**The `multi-` family of functions.**](#The-multi--family-of-functions)\n  (Thanks to Eric Smith for suggesting\n  [`multipartition`!](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)\n  Well, sort of.)\n  * `[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)`\n    now supports five (!) keyword-only parameters, allowing the caller\n    to tune its behavior to an amazing degree.\n  * Also, the original implementation of\n    `[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripNOT_SEPARATE)`\n    got its semantics a bit wrong; it was inconsistent and maybe a little buggy.\n  * [`multistrip`](#multistrips-separators-leftTrue-rightTrue)\n    is like `str.strip` but accepts an iterable of\n    separator strings.  It can strip from the left, right, both, or\n    neither (in which case it does nothing).\n  * [`multipartition`](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)\n    is like `str.partition`, but accepts an iterable\n    of separator strings.  It can also partition more than once,\n    and supports `reverse=True` which causes it to partition from the right\n    (like `str.rpartition`).\n  * Also added useful predefined lists of separators for use with all\n    the `multi` functions: [`whitespace`](#whitespace) and [`newlines`](#newlines),\n    with `ascii_` and `utf8_` versions of each, and `without_dos` variants of\n    all three [`newlines`](#newlines) variants.\n* Added the\n  [`Scheduler`](#schedulerregulatornone)\n  and\n  [`Heap`](#heapinone)\n  classes.  [`Scheduler`](#schedulerregulatornone)\n  is a replacement for Python's `sched.scheduler` class, with a modernized\n  interface and a major upgrade in functionality.  [`Heap`](#heapinone)\n  is an object-oriented interface to Python's `heapq` module, used by\n  [`Scheduler`](#schedulerregulatornone).\n  These are in their own modules.\n* Added\n  [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs)\n  and all the `lines_` modifiers.  These are great for writing little text parsers.\n  For more information, please see the deep-dive on\n  [**`lines` and lines modifier functions.**](#lines-and-lines-modifier-functions)\n* Removed`stripped_lines` and `rstripped_lines` from the `text` module,\n  as they're superceded by the far superior\n  [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs)\n  family.\n* Enhanced\n  [`normalize_whitespace`](#normalize_whitespaces-separatorsNone-replacementNone).\n  Added the `separators` and `replacement` parameters,\n  and added support for `bytes` objects.\n* Added the `count` parameter to\n  [`re_partition`](#re_partitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0)\n  and\n  [`re_rpartition`](#re_rpartitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0).\n\n**0.5.2**\n\n* Added `stripped_lines` and `rstripped_lines` to the [`text`](#bigtext) module.\n* Added support for `len` to the [`TopologicalSorter`](#topologicalsortergraphnone) object.\n\n**0.5.1**\n\n* Added\n  [`gently_title`](#gently_titles-apostrophesnone-double_quotesnone)\n  and\n  [`normalize_whitespace`](#normalize_whitespaces-separatorsNone-replacementNone)\n  to the [`text`](#bigtext) module.\n* Changed [`translate_filename_to_exfat`](#translate_filename_to_exfats)\n  to handle translating `':'` in a special way.\n  If the colon is followed by a space, then the colon is turned into `' -'`.\n  This yields a more natural translation when colons are used in text, e.g.\n  `'xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage'` is translated to `'xXx - The Return Of Xander Cage'`.\n  If the colon is not followed by a space, turns the colon into `'-'`.\n  This is good for tiresome modern gobbledygook like `'Re:code'`, which\n  will now be translated to `'Re-code'`.\n\n**0.5**\n\n* Initial release.\n",
