If you're using MacOSX, you'll need to run `pythonw wedap` in the main directory since conda prevents wxPython from accessing the display on Mac. \nIf you pip install (instead of conda installing) wxPython and Gooey on Mac you may be able to just run `wedap`. \nIf you wish to use the command line interface instead include any amount of arguments and include `-h` or `--help` to see the available options.\n\nFor MacOSX, you can set up an alias in your `.bash_profile` by running the following:\n```\necho \"alias wedap=pythonw /Path/to/wedap/git/repo/wedap/wedap\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n```\nThen simply type `wedap` on the terminal to run the wedap GUI.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall into a new conda env:\n``` bash\nconda env create --name wedap python=3.7+\nconda activate wedap\nconda install -c conda-forge gooey\npip install wedap\n```\nOr update an existing environmnent:\n``` bash\nconda activate ENV_NAME\nconda install -c conda-forge gooey\npip install wedap\n```\nOr, if you have the repository cloned, go into the main wedap directory (may have more up to date features):\n``` bash\nconda install -c conda-forge gooey\npip install .\n```\nIf you don't need the GUI, then installing gooey is not required\n\nNote that gooey is kindof troublesome to pip install in some systems, which is also why it's not included in the requirements (although it is required for the GUI). I am trying to fix this but for now I reccomend conda installing gooey.\n\n## Examples\n\nAfter installation, to run the CLI version and view available options:\n``` bash\nwedap --help\n```\nOr:\n``` bash\nwedap -h\n```\nTo start the GUI simply input:\n``` bash\nwedap\n```\nTo start the GUI on MacOSX:\n``` bash\npythonw /Path/to/wedap/git/repo/wedap/wedap\n```\nTo visualize the evolution of the pcoord for the example p53.h5 file via CLI:\n``` bash\nwedap -h5 wedap/data/p53.h5\n```\nTo do the same with the API:\n``` Python\nimport wedap\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nwedap.H5_Plot(h5=\"wedap/data/p53.h5\", data_type=\"evolution\").plot()\nplt.show()\n```\nThe resulting `p53.h5` file evolution plot will look like this:\n<p align=\"left\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/darianyang/wedap/blob/main/examples/p53_evo.png?raw=true\" alt=\"p53 evo plot\" width=\"400\">\n</p>\n\nSee the examples directory for more realistic applications using the Python API.\n\nEvolution plots are created by default using the CLI and GUI but average and instant probability distribution options are also available. To use one of your auxiliary datasets instead of the progress coordinate, just include the name of the aux dataset from your h5 file in the `--Xname` or `--Yname` fields:\n``` bash\nwedap -h5 wedap/data/p53.h5 --data_type average --Xname dihedral_10 --Yname dihedral_11\n```\nOr:\n``` bash\nwedap -h5 wedap/data/p53.h5 -dt average -X dihedral_10 -Y dihedral_11\n```\n\nThe resulting `p53.h5` file average plot of the dihedral aux datasets will look like this:\n<p align=\"left\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/darianyang/wedap/blob/main/examples/p53_avg_aux.png?raw=true\" alt=\"p53 avg aux plot\" width=\"400\">\n</p>\n\nIf you used a multi-dimensional progress coordinate and you want to use your pcoord for both the X and Y dimensions in a 2D average or instant plot, just use `pcoord` with the corresponding index set to the appropriate dimension (this also works with aux datasets which may have an additional dimension):\n``` bash\nwedap -h5 wedap/data/p53.h5 --data_type average --Xname pcoord --Xindex 0 --Yname pcoord --Yindex 1\n```\nOr:\n``` bash\nwedap -h5 wedap/data/p53.h5 -dt average -X pcoord -Xi 0 -Y pcoord -Yi 1\n```\nOr (since the default X options are the first pcoord, only the second pcoord needs to be specified):\n``` bash\nwedap -h5 wedap/data/p53.h5 -dt average -Y pcoord -Yi 1\n```\n\nThe resulting `p53.h5` file average plot of the pcoord datasets will look like this:\n<p align=\"left\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/darianyang/wedap/blob/main/examples/p53_avg_pcoord.png?raw=true\" alt=\"p53 avg pcoord plot\" width=\"400\">\n</p>\n\n## Motivation\nWESTPA already comes with some excellent analysis tools for generating probability distributions, so why is wedap needed?\n\nwedap was originally built as a way to simplify the original WESTPA plotting pipeline:\n\nNative WESTPA CLI-based Analysis Tools:\n\n    \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510       w_pdist        \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510        plothist         \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n    \u2502west.h5\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2502pdist.h5\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2502plot.pdf\u2502\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 --construct-dataset  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 --postprocess-function  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                   module.py                      plot_settings.py\n\n\nAnalysis using wedap:\n\n    \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510     wedap       \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n    \u2502west.h5\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2502plot.pdf\u2502\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 CLI/GUI/Python  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\nSo wedap can generate plots with more flexibilty and less intermediate files, providing an especially useful way to plot aux datasets and explore your h5 file. \n* The Python interface allows for advanced users to quickly generate a plot as a matplotlib axes object which can be further customized all in one Python script.\n    * For example, the moviepy package can be used with wedap to easily create a gif of your h5 file (see an example of this in `wedap/h5_movie.py`).\n    * The actual data can also be easily extracted and then analyzed (see `wedap/h5_cluster.py` for an example of k-means clustering using the data from a WESTPA west.h5 file). \n* The GUI allows for users who may not be comfortable with command line tools or Python to be able to quickly analyze their simulation results.\n* A CLI is also available if using wedap on a system without access to a display.\n\nSince the original implementation of wedap, many more features have been added that are not available using the WESTPA `w_pdist` and `plothist` tools, these include the following:\n* Easy WE tracing and plotting by inputing an iteration and segment, or by inputing the X and Y value to then query and trace.\n* 3D plots that replace the probability with another pcoord or aux dataset (`plot_mode=\"scatter3d\"`).\n* Selective basis states (if you have multiple basis states, only plot the probability contributions from specific states).\n    * See the `skip_basis` argument (available through the Python API only currently).\n* More to come!\n\nNote that the WESTPA analysis tools have features not available in wedap and may still be of interest to you.\n\n## Contributing\n\nHave an idea for a feature to add to wedap? Let me know and I may be able to incorporate it (dty7@pitt.edu).\n\nOr feel free to try developing it yourself! Features should be developed on branches. To create and switch to a branch, use the command:\n\n`git checkout -b new_branch_name`\n\nTo switch to an existing branch, use:\n\n`git checkout branch_name`\n\nTo submit your feature to be incorporated into the main branch, you should submit a `Pull Request`. The repository maintainers will review your pull request before accepting your changes.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) 2021, Darian Yang\n",
