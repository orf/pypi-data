            "description": "# Panda3D Type Stubs\n\nThis package contains type stubs for the Python bindings of\n[Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/), as well as for the included `direct`\npackage. The stubs are still in development, but should be usable with a wide\nrange of projects.\n\n## How to Use the Package\n\nRun `python -m pip install --upgrade types-panda3d` in whatever environment you\nwish to install the stubs. If Panda3D is also installed, a type checker should\nthen know what to do with the stubs.\n\n## How to Help\n\nCurrently, the best way to help is to test the stubs against your own Panda3D\ncode. Any false positives or negatives in a type checker's analysis are fair\ngame for a bug report. Given the size of the Panda3D library, testing on a\nwide variety of codebases is really the only practical way to ensure the stubs\nare useful and accurate.\n",
