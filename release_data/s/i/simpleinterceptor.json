            "description": "# Simple Interceptor\n\nIt is a simple tool that can be used to intercept methods of classes to apply advices on them.\n\n## Example\n\nIf we were to implement a bank transaction logic, it could be as simple as this.\n\n    class BankTransaction(object):\n        def transfer(self, amt):\n            print \"Transferring Rs. %d\" % amt\n\nAnd transaction would be done this simply as well.\n\n    obj = BankTransaction()\n    obj.transfer(1000)\n    \n![Non-intercept Example](example/non-intercept.jpg?raw=true \"Non-intercept Example\")\n\nNow, there could be various other concerns related to this requirement - *logging, checking if balance is \navailable, notifying user about the transaction status* etc. We could had written all of this logic there. \nBut in order to modularise it better or separate the cross-cutting concerns, we follow principles of AOP \nand apply the other concerns(advices) by intercepting the core method. This simple library is intended to \ndo this.\n\nSay the above concerns are implemented this trivially.\n\n    def start_transaction_log(*args, **kwargs):\n        print \"Starting transaction\"\n\n    def check_balance_available(*args, **kwargs):\n        print \"Balance check logic says Transaction allowed\"\n\n    def send_notification(*args, **kwargs):\n        print \"Transaction successful\"\n\nNow, in order to apply these logics to the ```transfer``` method, we would need to create an aspect and \ndecorate the ```BankTransaction``` class with the ```intercept``` decorator, featured by the tool, as shown \nunder. Instead of using transfer we could had used any regex pattern to match the method name. This allows \nto intercept multiple methods using the same pattern.\n\n    aspects = dict()\n    aspects[r'transfer'] = dict(\n        before=start_transaction_log,\n        around_before=check_balance_available,\n        after_success=send_notification)\n\n    from interceptor import intercept\n\n    BankTransaction = intercept(aspects)(BankTransaction)\n\n    obj = BankTransaction()\n    obj.transfer(1000)\n\n![Intercept Example](example/intercept.jpg?raw=true \"Intercept Example\")\n\n## Advices honoured\n\nThe tool accepts following self-explanatory advices. *before* logic is run before *around_before* and \n*around_after* is run before *after_success*. *after_exc* can be used to write exception logic. *around_after* \ndoesn't run in case of exception. \n\n- before\n- around_before\n- after_exc\n- around_after\n- after_success\n- after_finally",
