Run with a python IDE (e.g. visual studio)\n   - see the [test file](https://github.com/fsr-uwa/hydrogen-pfhx/blob/main/tests/test_model.py)\n\n2. A jupyter notebook using google colab\n   - [open the test notebook in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fsr-uwa/hydrogen-pfhx/blob/main/tests/test_model.ipynb)\n   - Click \"Copy to drive\" (just below filebar) then run the notebook.\n   - Note: saving data will require approval for google drive usage.\n",
