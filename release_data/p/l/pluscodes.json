            "description": "# pluscodes\n\nAn implementation of Google's Open Location Code algorithm forked from\nthe `openlocationcode==1.0.1` package.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Python implementation of Google's Open Location Code is not particularly\nPythonic with respect to its naming conventions. The core code is in both\n`openlocationcode` and this package are pure Python with no dependencies\noutside of the standard library.\n\nWe hope to presents geocoordinates using a more consistent API. A longer term goal\nto more efficiently handle bulk Plus Code assignments and further more\nreadily enable Plus Code lookup and categorization.\n\n# Installation\n\nThis package is available in PyPi, so simply\n\n```bash\npip install pluscodes\n```\n\n\n# Usage\n\nThe `PlusCode` constructor provides the main entry point for generating\nthe string Plus Code (encoding) and geographic area boundary (\"decoding\").\n\n```python\nfrom pluscodes import PlusCode, Area, Point\n\ngoogleplex = PlusCode(37.4223041570954, -122.08410042965134)\n\nassert googleplex.code == '849VCWC8+W9'\n\n# Get the geocoordinate bounds for the length 10 Plus Code area.\nassert googleplex.area == Area(\n    sw=Point(lat=37.42225, lon=-122.084125),\n    ne=Point(lat=37.422375, lon=-122.084),\n)\n\n# Decode a Plus Code into a geographic region.\nr_googleplex = PlusCode('849VCWC8+W9')\n\nassert googleplex.code == r_googleplex.code\nassert googleplex.area == r_googleplex.area\n```\n\nThis package also provides the original `openlocationcode==1.0.1` package\nas a subpackage for use-cases that wish to adhere to openlocationcode's\nAPI.\n\n\n```python\nimport pluscodes\nfrom pluscodes import openlocationcode\n\nexpected_code = '6FG22222+22'\nplus = pluscodes.encode(0.0, 0.0)\nolc = openlocationcode.encode(0.0, 0.0)\n\nassert (plus == expected_code) and (olc == expected_code)\n\nprint(openlocationcode.decode('6FG22222+22'))\n# [0.0, 0.0, 0.000125, 0.000125, 6.25e-05, 6.25e-05, 10]\n\nprint(pluscodes.decode('6FG22222+22'))\n# Area(sw=Point(lat=0.0, lon=0.0), ne=Point(lat=0.000125, lon=0.000125))\n```\n\n\n# Differences from openlocationcode\n\nThis package does not automatically validate or normalize inputs.\nFor example, it is assumed that all latitude values are in `[-90, 90]`\nand all longitude values are  in `[-180, 180]`.\n\nMoreover, the encoding and decoding APIs are combined in the PlusCode\nclass, with the decoding API producing a simple dataclass consisting of two\nPoint instances.\n",
