Only a concrete database implementation package such as \n[sqlite-historian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) that depends on this library can be \ninstalled as a VOLTTRON agent.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n - Python >= 3.8\n\n## Installation\n\nThis library can be installed using ```pip install volttron-lib-sql-historian```. However this is not necessary. Any \nhistorian agent that uses this library will automatically install it as part of its installation. For example, \ninstalling [SQLiteHistorian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) will automatically install \nvolttron-lib-sql-historian\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment requires poetry 1.2.2 or greater be used.  \nOne can install it from https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation.  The VOLTTRON team prefers to have the python \nenvironments created within the project directory.  Execute this command to make that behavior the default.\n\n```shell\npoetry config virtualenvs.in-project true\n```\n\nClone the repository.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-lib-sql-historian\n```\n\nChange to the repository directory and use poetry install to setup the environment.\n\n```shell\ncd volttron-lib-sql-historian\npoetry install\n```\n\n### Building Wheel\n\nTo build a wheel from this project execute the following:\n\n```shell\npoetry build\n```\n\nThe wheel and source distribution will be located in the ```./dist/``` directory.\n\n### Bumping version number of project\n\nTo bump the version number of the project execute one of the following.\n\n```shell\n# patch, minor, major, prepatch, preminor, premajor, prerelease\n\n# use patch\nuser@path$ poetry patch\n\n# output\nBumping version from 0.2.0-alpha.0 to 0.2.0\n\n# use prepatch\nuser@path$ poetry version prepatch\n\n# output\nBumping version from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1-alpha.0\n```\n\n# Disclaimer Notice\n\nThis material was prepared as an account of work sponsored by an agency of the\nUnited States Government.
