The library uses the native SAP GUI scripting engine for interaction with the desktop client application. \n\nOther dependances include the below packages as this library would not be possible without the hard work of so many others. \n\npywin32 by Mark Hammond\n\nWhat makes this library different from other SAP GUI libraries? \n\nThe main difference is the focus on testing end to end business processes in and around SAP GUI. While other libraries are similar in many aspects there are many additional comfort of life functions included that aren't in other libraries. \n\nThis package is available also on PyPi and available for install via pip. \n\n## To install and use this library simply do the following:\n\n1. pip install\n```\npip install SapGuiFramework\n```\n\n2. Import in Robot Framework\n```\n*** Settings ***\nLibrary    SapGuiFramework\n```\n\nIf you have not already you likely will need Scripting Tracker from Stefan Schnell.
