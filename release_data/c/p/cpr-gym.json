            "description": "# Consensus Protocol Research\n\nCPR is a toolbox for specifying, simulating, and attacking proof-of-work\nconsensus protocols. In this repository you find\n- protocol specifications for Bitcoin, Ethereum PoW, and others,\n- implementations of known attacks against these protocols,\n- a simulator that executes the specified protocols and attacks in a,\n  virtual environment,\n- tooling for automatic attack-search with reinforcement learning (RL) and\n- evaluation scripts and notebooks for the above.\n\nI'm working on [a website](https://pkel.github.io/cpr/) with more details.\n\n## Python/RL Quickstart\n\nCPR provides an OpenAI Gym environment for attack search with Python RL\nframeworks. If you meet the following **requirements**, you can install\nit from PyPI.\n\n- Unix-like operating system with x86_64 support\n- CPython, version >= 3.9\n\n```shell\npip install cpr-gym\n```\n\nIf this worked, you are ready to go. The following snippet simulates\n2016 steps of honest behaviour in Nakamoto consensus.\n\n```python\nimport gym\nimport cpr_gym\n\nenv = gym.make(\"cpr-nakamoto-v0\", episode_len = 2016)\nobs = env.reset()\ndone = False\nwhile not done:\n    action = env.policy(obs, \"honest\")\n    obs, rew, done, info = env.step(action)\n```\n\n## Install from Source\n\nThe protocol specifications and simulator are OCaml programs. Also most\nparts of the Gym environment are written in OCaml. The Python module\n`cpr_gym` loads the OCaml code from a pre-compiled shared object named\n`cpr_gym_engine.so`. In order to install the package from source, you\nhave to build this shared object and hence have the OCaml toolchain\ninstalled.\n\n**Opam** is the OCaml package manager. It's a bit like Python's `pip` or\nJavascript's `npm`. We use it do download and install our OCaml\ndependencies and to manage different versions of the OCaml compiler.\nMake sure that a recent version (>= 2.0) is installed on your system.\n[Follow these instructions](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).\nThen use `make setup` to get compiler and dependencies setup in the\ncurrent working directory under `_opam`. Later, e.g. when dependencies\nchange, run `make dependencies` to update the toolchain. If you ever\nsuspect that the OCaml dependencies are broken, and you do not know how\nto fix it, delete the `_opam` directory and run `make setup` again.\n\n**Dune** is an OCaml build system. We use it to build executables and\nshared objects, and to run tests. You do not have to interact with dune\ndirectly. Just run `make build` to test whether the OCaml build works.\n\nNow, installing `cpr_gym` as editable Python package should work. Try\n`pip install -e .` and follow the short Python example above. If it\nworks, you're ready to go.\n\nThe editable install will automatically invoke `dune` to keep the\n`cpr_gym_engine.so` up to date. If you change the OCaml code for the\nsimulator, these changes will be reflected in the Python gym\nenvironment. Updating the `cpr_gym_engine.so` happens during `import`,\nso you'll have to restart your kernel if you work from a notebook.\n\nIt might be useful to install all Python development dependencies with\n`pip install -r requirements.txt`. Afterwards, you can run the full test\nsuite, OCaml and Python, with `make test`.\n",
