This failure\ncan be recorded with BlackRed. After three failures within a certain time the account gets locked for an extended\nperiod of time. This limits brute force attacks. All time periods are configurable.\n\nIn a desktop application you would record the username in question with BlackRed. In a web environment, the requester's\nIP address would be the perfect.\n\nIn the redis database, two lists are kept: A watchlist that records the failures, and the blacklist that contains\nblocked items.\n\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n- Author: Juergen Edelbluth, `https://juergen.rocks/ <https://juergen.rocks/>`_,\n  `@JuergenRocks <https://twitter.com/JuergenRocks>`_\n- Build Status: `https://travis-ci.org/edelbluth/blackred <https://travis-ci.org/edelbluth/blackred>`_\n- Project Homepage: `https://github.com/edelbluth/blackred <https://github.com/edelbluth/blackred>`_\n- Documentation: `https://blackred.readthedocs.org/index.html <https://blackred.readthedocs.org/index.html>`_\n- PyPi Page: `https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blackred <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blackred>`_\n- German Description: `https://juergen.rocks/art/mit-blackred-benutzer-logins-absichern.html\n  <https://juergen.rocks/art/mit-blackred-benutzer-logins-absichern.html>`_\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright 2015 Juergen Edelbluth\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n\nSee LICENSE.txt for complete License Text",
