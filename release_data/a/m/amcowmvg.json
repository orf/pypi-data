            "description": "# AMC-OWMVG\r\n## Antimony Model Creator - Olivia Walsh, Matthew Van Ginneken\r\n\r\nThis package allows the user to visualize a reaction via a steady state graph.  The user can create and submit their own reactions on the Flask Webpage, or they can submit an antimony txt file or a SBML file also through the webpage.  The Webpage will run a simulation using the reactions with tellurium and show the steady state graph.  \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nTo install this package the user should open up to their terminal and navigate to the directory of choice (example below to get to Desktop)\r\n> cd Desktop\r\n\r\nNext the user must use a pip installation of the program\r\n> pip install AMC-OWMVG\r\n\r\nOnce the terminal has confirmed installation, the user must make a python file and fill it with the following code. Then they execute their python file using either a terminal or IDE. \r\n>    import AMCowmvg as AMC\r\n>    AMC.runApp()\r\n\r\nThis will produce a few lines of response including a website link, the user should copy and paste this into their browser.\r\n",
