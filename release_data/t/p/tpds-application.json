Public Domain Dedication ========================  The persons who have associated their work with this project (the \"Dedicator\": David Goodger and the many contributors to the Docutils project) hereby dedicate the entire copyright, less the exceptions_ listed below, in the work of authorship known as \"Docutils\" identified below (the \"Work\") to the public domain.  The primary repository for the Work is the Internet World Wide Web site <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>.

Files dedicated to the public domain may be identified by the inclusion, near the beginning of each file, of a declaration of the form::  Copyright: This document/module/DTD/stylesheet/file/etc. has been placed in the public domain.  Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of Dedicator's heirs and successors.  Dedicator intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the Work.  Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the Work.  Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or conceived.

Package: freetype License: GPL-2.0-only and LicenseRef-FreeType The FreeType Project LICENSE ----------------------------  2006-Jan-27  Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg    Introduction ============  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the FreeType Project.  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:  o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)  o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)  o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the FreeType code. (`credits')  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products. We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.   Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus encourage you to use the following text:  \"\"\" Portions of this software are copyright \u00c2\u00a9 <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved. \"\"\"  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.   Legal Terms ===========  0. Definitions --------------  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'. This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType engine'.  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive. If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as specified below.  1. No Warranty --------------  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.  2. Redistribution -----------------  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile, display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:  o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered, original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source files.  o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid to us.  3. Advertising --------------  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it. Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.  4. Contacts -----------  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:  o freetype@nongnu.org  Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution. If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.  o freetype-devel@nongnu.org  Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc.  Our home page can be found at  https://www.freetype.org  Package: frozenlist License: Apache Software License Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION  1.

This includes all of the IPython subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/ipython/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.

If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly the order listed) before diving into the code.   OVERVIEW ========  This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression.  JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing \"real-world\" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images, very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment with various compression settings.  This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.  We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications.  In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included \"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.  The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.  We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products. No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.   LEGAL ISSUES ============  In plain English:  1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!) 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us. 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.  In legalese:  The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided \"AS IS\", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.  This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.  Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group\". (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.  These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.  Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's software\".  We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.   ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.  The Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.  It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.  The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce \"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.  We are required to state that \"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.\"   REFERENCES ==========  We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to understand the innards of the JPEG software.  The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is Wallace, Gregory K.  \"The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard\", Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44. (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression, applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics) omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes.  A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in \"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here...  The best full description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG in existence, and we highly recommend it.  The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead; it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.) In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212) 642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of 1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7% shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.  Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3, a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.  The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format.  For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, revision 1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from: Literature Department C-Cube Microsystems, Inc. 1778 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314 A PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.  The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6). Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.   ARCHIVE LOCATIONS =================  The \"official\" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived as ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.  Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.  You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible \"zip\" archive format from the SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12 \"JPEG Tools\".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net release.  The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups. It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/ and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/. If you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with body send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2   RELATED SOFTWARE ================  Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to obtain them on Internet.  If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/. Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is; you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.  A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford, is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use; it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG, which we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)   FILE FORMAT WARS ================  Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library. The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a concrete file format.  Some vendors \"filled in the blanks\" on their own, creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to exchange compressed files.)  The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or \"low end\" representation. We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF Technical Note #2) for \"high end\" applications that need to record a lot of additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely supported, unfortunately.  The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF. SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not. (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)  Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist. We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't use a proprietary file format!   TO DO =====  The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality. The current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be very good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary smoothing, \"poor man's variable quantization\", and other means of improving quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.  In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file format.  As always, speeding things up is of great interest.  Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

Package: libiconv License: GPL and LGPL GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Package: libusb License: LGPL-2.1-or-later GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.

Package: sqlite License: Unlicense  SQLite Is Public Domain  All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. All contributors are citizens of countries that allow creative works to be dedicated into the public domain. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.  The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the \"configure\" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.  All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.  Open-Source, not Open-Contribution SQLite is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with those copies, without limitation. But SQLite is not open-contribution. In order to keep SQLite in the public domain and ensure that the code does not become contaminated with proprietary or licensed content, the project does not accept patches from people who have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution into the public domain.  All of the code in SQLite is original, having been written specifically for use by SQLite. No code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet.  Warranty of Title SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license. Even so, some organizations want legal proof of their right to use SQLite. Circumstances where this might occurs include the following:  Your company desires indemnity against claims of copyright infringement. You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the public domain. You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain. You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have the legal right to use and distribute SQLite. Your legal department tells you that you must purchase a license. If any of the above circumstances apply to you, Hwaci, the company that employs all the developers of SQLite, will sell you a Warranty of Title for SQLite. A Warranty of Title is a legal document that asserts that the claimed authors of SQLite are the true authors, and that the authors have the legal right to dedicate the SQLite to the public domain, and that Hwaci will vigorously defend against challenges to those claims. All proceeds from the sale of SQLite Warranties of Title are used to fund continuing improvement and support of SQLite.  Contributed Code In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, the project does not accept patches. If you would like to suggest a change and you include a patch as a proof-of-concept, that would be great. However, please do not be offended if we rewrite your patch from scratch.

This includes all of the IPython subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.  Package: typing-extensions License: Python Software Foundation License A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.  Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL- from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.

Package: PyGithub License: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License (LGPL) GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS  0. Definitions.  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  1. Source Code.  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.  2. Basic Permissions.  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.  7. Additional Terms.  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.  8. Termination.  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  11. Patents.  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.  14. Revised Versions of this License.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

To the extent that Licensee\u2019s Modified Software so breaks source or binary compatibility with the Licensed Software, Licensee acknowledges that The Qt Company's ability to provide Support may be prevented or limited and Licensee's ability to make use of Updates may be restricted.  Licensee may, at its sole and absolute discretion, choose to submit Modified Software to The Qt Company (\u201cSubmitted Modified Software\u201d) in connection with Licensee\u2019s Support request, service request or otherwise. In the event Licensee does so, then, Licensee hereby grants The Qt Company a sublicensable, assignable, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid-up license, under all of Licensee\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights, to reproduce, adapt, translate, modify, and prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, make available and distribute such Submitted Modified Software as The Qt Company sees fit at its free and absolute discretion.  3. LICENSES GRANTED  3.1 Development with Licensed Software  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, The Qt Company grants to Licensee a personal, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, valid for the License Term, to use, modify and copy the Licensed Software by Designated Users on the Development Platforms for the sole purposes of designing, developing, demonstrating and testing Application(s) and/or Devices, and to provide thereto related support and other related services to end-user Customers.

Upon expiry of the initially agreed License Term, the respective License Terms shall be automatically extended to one or more Renewal Term(s), unless and until either Party notifies the other Party in writing that it does not wish to continue the License Term, such notification to be provided to the other Party no less than ninety (90) days before expiry of the respective License Term. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, Renewal Term shall be of equal length with the initial Term.  Any such Renewal Term shall be subject to License Fees agreed between the Parties or, if no advance agreement exists, subject to The Qt Company\u2019s standard pricing applicable at the commencement date of any such Renewal Term.  3.2 Distribution of Applications  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, The Qt Company grants to Licensee a personal, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable (for cause pursuant to this Agreement) right and license, valid for the Term, to  (i) distribute, by itself or through its Contractors, Redistributables as installed, incorporated or integrated into Applications for execution on the Deployment Platforms, and  (ii) grant sublicenses to Redistributables, as distributed hereunder, for Customers solely for Customer\u2019s internal use and to the extent necessary in order for the Customers to use the Applications for their respective intended purposes.

Such right may be available for the Licensee subject to a separate software development kit (\u201cSDK\u201d) license agreement to be concluded with The Qt Company;  (vii) Licensee shall not grant the Customers a right to (i) make copies of the Redistributables except when and to the extent required to use the Applications and/or Devices for their intended purpose, (ii) modify the Redistributables or create derivative works thereof, (iii) decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer Redistributables, or (iv) redistribute any copy or portion of the Redistributables to any third party, except as part of the onward sale of the Device on which the Redistributables are installed;  (viii) Licensee shall not and shall cause that its Affiliates or Contractors shall not a) in any way combine, incorporate or integrate Licensed Software with, or use Licensed Software for creation of, any software created with or incorporating Open Source Qt, or b) incorporate or integrate Applications into a hardware device or product other than a Device, unless Licensee has received an advance written permission from The Qt Company to do so. Absent such written permission, any and all distribution by the Licensee during the Term of a hardware device or product a) which incorporate or integrate any part of Licensed Software or Open Source Qt; or b) where the main user interface or substantial functionality is provided by software build with Licensed Software or Open Source Qt or otherwise depends on the Licensed Software or Open Source Qt, shall be considered as a Device distribution under this Agreement and dependent on compliance thereof (including but not limited to obligation to pay applicable License Fees for such distribution);  (ix) Licensee shall cause all of its Affiliates and Contractors entitled to make use of the licenses granted under this Agreement, to be contractually bound to comply with the relevant terms of this Agreement and not to use the Licensed Software beyond the terms hereof and for any purposes other than operating within the scope of their services for Licensee. Licensee shall be responsible for any and all actions and omissions of its Affiliates and Contractors relating to the Licensed Software and use thereof (including but not limited to payment of all applicable License Fees);  (x) Except when and to the extent explicitly provided in this Section 3, Licensee shall not transfer, publish, disclose, display or otherwise make available the Licensed Software;  ; and  (xi) Licensee shall not attempt or enlist a third party to conduct or attempt to conduct any of the above.  Above terms shall not be applicable if and to the extent they conflict with any mandatory provisions of any applicable laws.  Any use of Licensed Software beyond the provisions of this Agreement is strictly prohibited and requires an additional license from The Qt Company.  4. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE  The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively \"Third Party Software\") to implement various functions. Third Party Software does not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Software may be included in the Licensed Software. Such Third Party Software will be listed in the \".../src/3rdparty\" source tree delivered with the Licensed Software or documented in the Licensed Software, as such may be amended from time to time. Licensee acknowledges that use or distribution of Third Party Software is in all respects subject to applicable license terms of applicable third party right holders.  5. PRE-RELEASE CODE  The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality marked or otherwise stated as \u201cTechnology Preview\u201d, \u201cAlpha\u201d, \u201cBeta\u201d or similar designation. Such pre-release code may be present in order to provide experimental support for new platforms or preliminary versions of one or more new functionalities. The pre-release code may not be at the level of performance and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering of the Licensed Software. The pre-release parts of the Licensed Software may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially modified by The Qt Company prior to the first commercial product release, if any. The Qt Company is under no obligation to make pre-release code commercially available, or provide any Support or Updates relating thereto. The Qt Company assumes no liability whatsoever regarding any pre-release code, but any use thereof is exclusively at Licensee\u2019s own risk and expense.  6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER  The Qt Company hereby represents and warrants that it has the power and authority to grant the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement.  Except as set forth above, the Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee \"as is\" and Licensee\u2019s exclusive remedy and The Qt Company\u2019s entire liability for errors in the Licensed Software shall be limited, at The Qt Company\u2019s option, to correction of the error, replacement of the Licensed Software or return of the applicable fees paid for the defective Licensed Software for the time period during which the License is not able to utilize the Licensed Software under the terms of this Agreement.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE QT COMPANY ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES, DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON- INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE. THE QT COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL SATISFY LICENSEE\u2019S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT IT WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DEFECT OR ERROR OR THAT THE OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. ALL USE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AT THE SOLE RISK OF AND RESPONSIBILITY OF LICENSEE.  7. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  7.1 Limitation of Liability  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR GOODWILL OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE COST, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND, HOWSOEVER ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. PARTIES SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT LICENSEE\u2019S OBLIGATION TO PAY LICENSE AND OTHER FEES CORRESPONDING TO ACTUAL USAGE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS A DIRECT DAMAGE.  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY\u2019S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE LICENSE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE TO THE QT COMPANY FROM LICENSEE DURING THE PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT RESULTING IN SUCH LIABILITY.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 7 ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE QT COMPANY AND LICENSEE AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED UPON THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  7.2 Licensee\u00b4s Indemnification  Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless The Qt Company from and against any claim, injury, judgment, settlement, loss or expense, including attorneys' fees related to: (a) Licensee\u2019s misrepresentation in connection with The Qt Company or the Licensed Software or breach of this Agreement, (b) the Application or Device (except where such cause of liability is solely attributable to the Licensed Software).  8. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES  Upon due payment of the agreed License Fees the Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use the Online Services during the License Term, provided, however, that in the event the License Term is longer than 36 months, Support is provided only for the first 12 months, unless the Parties specifically otherwise agree.  Unless otherwise decided by The Company at its free and absolute discretion, Upgrades will not be included in the Support but may be available subject to additional fees.  From time to time The Qt Company may change the Support terms, provided that during the respective ongoing License Term the level of Support provided by The Qt Company may not be reduced without the consent of the Licensee.  Unless otherwise agreed, The Qt Company shall not be responsible for providing any service or support to Customers.  9. CONFIDENTIALITY  Each Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may receive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d). Accordingly, when a Party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) receives Confidential Information from the other Party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own confidential and proprietary information.  Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the minimum extent necessary.  The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade secret laws.  10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT  10.1 License Fees  License Fees are described in The Qt Company\u2019s standard price list, quote or Purchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be.  The License Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or for any reason whatsoever.  10.2 Ordering Licenses  Licensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant to agreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon, at The Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.  Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable to The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a \u201cPurchase Order\u201d) for confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the Parties.  10.3 Distribution License Packs  Unless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of Distribution License Packs.  Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available for installing, bundling or integrating (all jointly \u201cinstalling\u201d) the Redistributables with the Devices or for otherwise distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this Agreement.  Each time Licensee \u201cinstalls\u201d or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution License is used, and Licensee\u2019s account of available Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.  Licensee may \u201cinstall\u201d copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.  Redistributables will be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d into a Device when one of the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables have been loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee\u2019s premises or b) the Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory (or sold) for the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use (or pay for) more than one Distribution License for each individual Device, e.g. in a situation where a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after delivery to a distributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee includes a back-up copy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage medium along with the product, that backup copy of the Redistributables will not be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d and will not require an additional Distribution License.  10.4 Payment Terms  License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice from The Qt Company.  The Qt Company will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this Agreement and/or after The Qt Company receives a Purchase Order from Licensee.  A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid balances that remain past due.  The Qt Company shall have the right to suspend, terminate or withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but not limited to the Developer License, Distribution License, and Support, should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion.  10.5 Taxes  All License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax and other taxes, duties or tariffs (\u201cTaxes\u201d). Such applicable Taxes shall be paid by Licensee, or, where applicable, in lieu of payment of such Taxes, Licensee shall provide an exemption certificate to The Qt Company and any applicable authority.  11 RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS  11.1 Licensee\u2019s Record-keeping  Licensee shall at all times maintain accurate and up-to-date written records of Licensee\u2019s activities related to the use of Licensed Software and distribution of Redistributables. The records shall be adequate to determine Licensee\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and to demonstrate the number of Designated Users and Redistributables distributed by Licensee. The records shall conform to good accounting practices reasonably acceptable to The Qt Company.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company\u2019s request to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report on Licensee\u2019s usage of Licensed Software, such report to copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, and also detailing the number of undistributed copies of Redistributables made by Licensee and remaining in its account contain information, in sufficient detail, on (i) amount of users working with Licensed Software, (ii) copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, (iii) number of undistributed copies of Redistributables and corresponding number of unused Distribution Licenses remaining on Licensee\u2019s account, and (iv) any other information as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to time.  11.2. The Qt Company\u2019s Audit Rights  The Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company\u2019s, may, upon at least five (5) business days\u2019 prior written notice and at its expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Redistributables, but not more frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee\u2019s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee\u2019s Records. All such Licensee\u2019s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.  If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee agrees to immediately pay The Qt Company any amounts owed for such unauthorized use.  In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (underpayment of more than 5% of License Fees shall always be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.  12 TERM AND TERMINATION  12.1 Term  This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and remain in force for as long as there is any Development License(s) in force (\u201cTerm\u201d), unless and until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.  12.2 Termination by The Qt Company  The Qt Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the Licensee is in material breach of any obligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice period.  12.3 Mutual Right to Terminate  Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice in the event that the other Party becomes insolvent, files for any form of bankruptcy, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a receiver, administrative receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a substantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent to any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other Party.  12.4 Parties\u00b4 Rights and Duties upon Termination  Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement Licensee shall cease and shall cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates\u2019 and Contractors\u2019) to cease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the Redistributables under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires or is terminated:  (i) as a result of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development License(s) as set forth in Section 3.1, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional licenses as set forth in Section 10.2; or  (ii) for reason other than by The Qt Company pursuant to item (i) above or pursuant to Section 12.2, then the Licensee is entitled, for a period of six (6) months after the effective date of termination, to continue distribution of Devices under the Distribution Licenses paid but unused at such effective date of termination.  Upon any such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Qt Company all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify the same to The Qt Company upon its request, provided however that Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may reasonably require in providing continued support to Customers.  Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Qt Company prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee shall immediately pay to The Qt Company all such fees upon the effective date of termination.  Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated Redistributables).  12.5 Extension in case of bankruptcy  In the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to party, who has assumed The Qt Company\u2019s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.  13. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL VENUE  In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Inc., a Delaware Corporation, then:  (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding its choice of law provisions;  (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and  (iii) any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, USA, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Ltd., a Finnish Company, then:  (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Finland, excluding its choice of law provisions;  (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and  (iii) any disputes, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of Finland Chamber of Commerce.

This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  14. GENERAL PROVISIONS  14.1 No Assignment  Except in the case of a merger or sale of substantially all of its corporate assets, Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of The Qt Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Qt Company shall be entitled to freely assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement.  14.2 No Third Party Representations  Licensee shall make no representations or warranties concerning the Licensed Software on behalf of The Qt Company. Any representation or warranty Licensee makes or purports to make on The Qt Company\u2019s behalf shall be void as to The Qt Company.  14.3 Surviving Sections  Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive termination of this Agreement shall so be deemed to survive.  14.4 Entire Agreement  This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the License Certificate and any applicable Purchase Order constitute the complete agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the subject matters discussed herein.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement will prevail over the terms of the Purchase Order with respect to such conflict or inconsistency.

If the Force Majeure Event results in a delay or non-performance of a Party for a period of three (3) months or longer, then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect without any liability (except for the obligations of payment arising prior to the event of Force Majeure) towards the other Party.  14.7 Notices  Any notice given by one Party to the other shall be deemed properly given and deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving Party in writing or when successfully delivered to the recipient by hand, fax, or special courier during normal business hours on a business day to the addresses specified for each Party on the signature page.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.

Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.

Package: paramiko License: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License (LGPL) GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Suite 500, Boston, MA  02110-1335  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Suite 500, Boston, MA  02110-1335  USA  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice  That's all there is to it!

Except as set forth above, the Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee \"as is\" and Licensee\u2019s exclusive remedy and The Qt Company\u2019s entire liability for errors in the Licensed Software shall be limited, at The Qt Company\u2019s option, to correction of the error, replacement of the Licensed Software or return of the applicable fees paid for the defective Licensed Software for the time period during which the License is not able to utilize the Licensed Software under the terms of this Agreement.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE QT COMPANY ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES, DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON- INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE. THE QT COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL SATISFY LICENSEE\u2019S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT IT WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DEFECT OR ERROR OR THAT THE OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. ALL USE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AT THE SOLE RISK OF AND RESPONSIBILITY OF LICENSEE.  7. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  7.1 Limitation of Liability  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR GOODWILL OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE COST, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND, HOWSOEVER ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. PARTIES SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT LICENSEE\u2019S OBLIGATION TO PAY LICENSE AND OTHER FEES CORRESPONDING TO ACTUAL USAGE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS A DIRECT DAMAGE.  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY\u2019S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE LICENSE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE TO THE QT COMPANY FROM LICENSEE DURING THE PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT RESULTING IN SUCH LIABILITY.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 7 ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE QT COMPANY AND LICENSEE AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED UPON THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  7.2 Licensee\u00b4s Indemnification  Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless The Qt Company from and against any claim, injury, judgment, settlement, loss or expense, including attorneys' fees related to: (a) Licensee\u2019s misrepresentation in connection with The Qt Company or the Licensed Software or breach of this Agreement, (b) the Application or Device (except where such cause of liability is solely attributable to the Licensed Software).  8. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES  Upon due payment of the agreed License Fees the Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use the Online Services during the License Term, provided, however, that in the event the License Term is longer than 36 months, Support is provided only for the first 12 months, unless the Parties specifically otherwise agree.  Unless otherwise decided by The Company at its free and absolute discretion, Upgrades will not be included in the Support but may be available subject to additional fees.  From time to time The Qt Company may change the Support terms, provided that during the respective ongoing License Term the level of Support provided by The Qt Company may not be reduced without the consent of the Licensee.  Unless otherwise agreed, The Qt Company shall not be responsible for providing any service or support to Customers.  9. CONFIDENTIALITY  Each Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may receive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d). Accordingly, when a Party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) receives Confidential Information from the other Party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own confidential and proprietary information.  Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the minimum extent necessary.  The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade secret laws.  10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT  10.1 License Fees  License Fees are described in The Qt Company\u2019s standard price list, quote or Purchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be.  The License Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or for any reason whatsoever.  10.2 Ordering Licenses  Licensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant to agreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon, at The Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.  Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable to The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a \u201cPurchase Order\u201d) for confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the Parties.  10.3 Distribution License Packs  Unless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of Distribution License Packs.  Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available for installing, bundling or integrating (all jointly \u201cinstalling\u201d) the Redistributables with the Devices or for otherwise distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this Agreement.  Each time Licensee \u201cinstalls\u201d or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution License is used, and Licensee\u2019s account of available Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.  Licensee may \u201cinstall\u201d copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.  Redistributables will be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d into a Device when one of the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables have been loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee\u2019s premises or b) the Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory (or sold) for the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use (or pay for) more than one Distribution License for each individual Device, e.g. in a situation where a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after delivery to a distributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee includes a back-up copy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage medium along with the product, that backup copy of the Redistributables will not be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d and will not require an additional Distribution License.  10.4 Payment Terms  License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice from The Qt Company.  The Qt Company will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this Agreement and/or after The Qt Company receives a Purchase Order from Licensee.  A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid balances that remain past due.  The Qt Company shall have the right to suspend, terminate or withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but not limited to the Developer License, Distribution License, and Support, should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion.  10.5 Taxes  All License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax and other taxes, duties or tariffs (\u201cTaxes\u201d). Such applicable Taxes shall be paid by Licensee, or, where applicable, in lieu of payment of such Taxes, Licensee shall provide an exemption certificate to The Qt Company and any applicable authority.  11 RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS  11.1 Licensee\u2019s Record-keeping  Licensee shall at all times maintain accurate and up-to-date written records of Licensee\u2019s activities related to the use of Licensed Software and distribution of Redistributables. The records shall be adequate to determine Licensee\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and to demonstrate the number of Designated Users and Redistributables distributed by Licensee. The records shall conform to good accounting practices reasonably acceptable to The Qt Company.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company\u2019s request to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report on Licensee\u2019s usage of Licensed Software, such report to copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, and also detailing the number of undistributed copies of Redistributables made by Licensee and remaining in its account contain information, in sufficient detail, on (i) amount of users working with Licensed Software, (ii) copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, (iii) number of undistributed copies of Redistributables and corresponding number of unused Distribution Licenses remaining on Licensee\u2019s account, and (iv) any other information as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to time.  11.2. The Qt Company\u2019s Audit Rights  The Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company\u2019s, may, upon at least five (5) business days\u2019 prior written notice and at its expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Redistributables, but not more frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee\u2019s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee\u2019s Records. All such Licensee\u2019s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.  If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee agrees to immediately pay The Qt Company any amounts owed for such unauthorized use.  In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (underpayment of more than 5% of License Fees shall always be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.  12 TERM AND TERMINATION  12.1 Term  This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and remain in force for as long as there is any Development License(s) in force (\u201cTerm\u201d), unless and until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.  12.2 Termination by The Qt Company  The Qt Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the Licensee is in material breach of any obligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice period.  12.3 Mutual Right to Terminate  Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice in the event that the other Party becomes insolvent, files for any form of bankruptcy, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a receiver, administrative receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a substantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent to any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other Party.  12.4 Parties\u00b4 Rights and Duties upon Termination  Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement Licensee shall cease and shall cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates\u2019 and Contractors\u2019) to cease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the Redistributables under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires or is terminated:  (i) as a result of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development License(s) as set forth in Section 3.1, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional licenses as set forth in Section 10.2; or  (ii) for reason other than by The Qt Company pursuant to item (i) above or pursuant to Section 12.2, then the Licensee is entitled, for a period of six (6) months after the effective date of termination, to continue distribution of Devices under the Distribution Licenses paid but unused at such effective date of termination.  Upon any such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Qt Company all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify the same to The Qt Company upon its request, provided however that Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may reasonably require in providing continued support to Customers.  Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Qt Company prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee shall immediately pay to The Qt Company all such fees upon the effective date of termination.  Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated Redistributables).  12.5 Extension in case of bankruptcy  In the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to party, who has assumed The Qt Company\u2019s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.  13. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL VENUE  In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Inc., a Delaware Corporation, then:  (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding its choice of law provisions;  (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and  (iii) any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, USA, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Ltd., a Finnish Company, then:  (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Finland, excluding its choice of law provisions;  (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and  (iii) any disputes, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of Finland Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of one (1), or if either Party so requires, of three (3), arbitrators. The award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be held in Helsinki, Finland and the process shall be conducted in the English language. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  14. GENERAL PROVISIONS  14.1 No Assignment  Except in the case of a merger or sale of substantially all of its corporate assets, Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of The Qt Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Qt Company shall be entitled to freely assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement.  14.2 No Third Party Representations  Licensee shall make no representations or warranties concerning the Licensed Software on behalf of The Qt Company. Any representation or warranty Licensee makes or purports to make on The Qt Company\u2019s behalf shall be void as to The Qt Company.  14.3 Surviving Sections  Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive termination of this Agreement shall so be deemed to survive.  14.4 Entire Agreement  This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the License Certificate and any applicable Purchase Order constitute the complete agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the subject matters discussed herein.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement will prevail over the terms of the Purchase Order with respect to such conflict or inconsistency.  Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that this Agreement prevails over any click-to-accept or similar agreements the Designated Users may need to accept online upon download of the Licensed Software, as may be required by The Qt Company\u2019s applicable processes relating to Licensed Software.  14.5 Modifications  No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless contained in a writing executed by an authorized representative of each Party. No term or condition contained in Licensee's Purchase Order shall apply unless expressly accepted by The Qt Company in writing.  14.6 Force Majeure  Except for the payment obligations hereunder, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any delay or non-performance of its obligations hereunder in the event and to the extent that such delay or non-performance is due to an event of act of God, terrorist attack or other similar unforeseeable catastrophic event that prevents either Party for fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and which such Party cannot avoid or circumvent (\u201cForce Majeure Event\u201d).  If the Force Majeure Event results in a delay or non-performance of a Party for a period of three (3) months or longer, then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect without any liability (except for the obligations of payment arising prior to the event of Force Majeure) towards the other Party.  14.7 Notices  Any notice given by one Party to the other shall be deemed properly given and deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving Party in writing or when successfully delivered to the recipient by hand, fax, or special courier during normal business hours on a business day to the addresses specified for each Party on the signature page. Each communication and document made or delivered by one Party to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be in the English language.  14.8 Export Control  Licensee acknowledges that the Redistributables may be subject to export control restrictions under the applicable laws of respective countries. Licensee shall fully comply with all applicable export license restrictions and requirements as well as with all laws and regulations relating to the Redistributables and exercise of licenses hereunder and shall procure all necessary governmental authorizations, including without limitation, all necessary licenses, approvals, permissions or consents, where necessary for the re-exportation of the Redistributables, Applications and/or Devices.  14.9 No Implied License  There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with The Qt Company and its licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the Licensed Software with any other software or hardware not delivered by The Qt Company under this Agreement.  14.10 Attorney Fees  The prevailing Party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with such action.  14.11 Severability  If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, have caused this Agreement to be executed by Licensee's authorized representative installing the Licensed Software and accepting the terms hereof in connection therewith.

Package: freetype License: GPL-2.0-only and LicenseRef-FreeType The FreeType Project LICENSE ----------------------------  2006-Jan-27  Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg    Introduction ============  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the FreeType Project.  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:  o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)  o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)  o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the FreeType code. (`credits')  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products. We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.   Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus encourage you to use the following text:  \"\"\" Portions of this software are copyright \u00c2\u00a9 <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved. \"\"\"  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.   Legal Terms ===========  0. Definitions --------------  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'. This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType engine'.  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive. If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as specified below.  1. No Warranty --------------  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.  2. Redistribution -----------------  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile, display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:  o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered, original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source files.  o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid to us.  3. Advertising --------------  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it. Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.  4. Contacts -----------  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:  o freetype@nongnu.org  Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution. If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.  o freetype-devel@nongnu.org  Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc.  Our home page can be found at  https://www.freetype.org  Package: frozenlist License: Apache Software License Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION  1.

This includes all of the IPython subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/ipython/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.

If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly the order listed) before diving into the code.   OVERVIEW ========  This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression.  JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing \"real-world\" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images, very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment with various compression settings.  This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.  We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications.  In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included \"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.  The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.  We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products. No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.   LEGAL ISSUES ============  In plain English:  1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!) 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us. 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.  In legalese:  The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided \"AS IS\", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.  This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.  Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group\". (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.  These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.  Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's software\".  We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.   ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.  The Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.  It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.  The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce \"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.  We are required to state that \"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.\"   REFERENCES ==========  We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to understand the innards of the JPEG software.  The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is Wallace, Gregory K.  \"The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard\", Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44. (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression, applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics) omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes.  A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in \"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here...  The best full description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG in existence, and we highly recommend it.  The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead; it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.) In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212) 642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of 1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7% shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.  Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3, a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.  The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format.  For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, revision 1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from: Literature Department C-Cube Microsystems, Inc. 1778 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314 A PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.  The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6). Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.   ARCHIVE LOCATIONS =================  The \"official\" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived as ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.  Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.  You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible \"zip\" archive format from the SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12 \"JPEG Tools\".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net release.  The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups. It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/ and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/. If you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with body send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2   RELATED SOFTWARE ================  Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to obtain them on Internet.  If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/. Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is; you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.  A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford, is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use; it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG, which we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)   FILE FORMAT WARS ================  Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library. The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a concrete file format.  Some vendors \"filled in the blanks\" on their own, creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to exchange compressed files.)  The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or \"low end\" representation. We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF Technical Note #2) for \"high end\" applications that need to record a lot of additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely supported, unfortunately.  The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF. SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not. (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)  Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist. We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't use a proprietary file format!   TO DO =====  The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality. The current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be very good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary smoothing, \"poor man's variable quantization\", and other means of improving quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.  In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file format.  As always, speeding things up is of great interest.  Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

Package: libiconv License: GPL and LGPL GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Package: libusb License: LGPL-2.1-or-later GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.

Package: sqlite License: Unlicense  SQLite Is Public Domain  All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. All contributors are citizens of countries that allow creative works to be dedicated into the public domain. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.  The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the \"configure\" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.  All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.  Open-Source, not Open-Contribution SQLite is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with those copies, without limitation. But SQLite is not open-contribution. In order to keep SQLite in the public domain and ensure that the code does not become contaminated with proprietary or licensed content, the project does not accept patches from people who have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution into the public domain.  All of the code in SQLite is original, having been written specifically for use by SQLite. No code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet.  Warranty of Title SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license. Even so, some organizations want legal proof of their right to use SQLite. Circumstances where this might occurs include the following:  Your company desires indemnity against claims of copyright infringement. You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the public domain. You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain. You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have the legal right to use and distribute SQLite. Your legal department tells you that you must purchase a license. If any of the above circumstances apply to you, Hwaci, the company that employs all the developers of SQLite, will sell you a Warranty of Title for SQLite. A Warranty of Title is a legal document that asserts that the claimed authors of SQLite are the true authors, and that the authors have the legal right to dedicate the SQLite to the public domain, and that Hwaci will vigorously defend against challenges to those claims. All proceeds from the sale of SQLite Warranties of Title are used to fund continuing improvement and support of SQLite.  Contributed Code In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, the project does not accept patches. If you would like to suggest a change and you include a patch as a proof-of-concept, that would be great. However, please do not be offended if we rewrite your patch from scratch.

This includes all of the IPython subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.  Package: typing-extensions License: Python Software Foundation License A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.  Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL- from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.

Package: PyGithub License: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License (LGPL) GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS  0. Definitions.  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  1. Source Code.  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.  2. Basic Permissions.  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.  7. Additional Terms.  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.  8. Termination.  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  11. Patents.  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.  14. Revised Versions of this License.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE  The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively \"Third Party Software\") to implement various functions. Third Party Software does not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Software may be included in the Licensed Software. Such Third Party Software will be listed in the \".../src/3rdparty\" source tree delivered with the Licensed Software or documented in the Licensed Software, as such may be amended from time to time. Licensee acknowledges that use or distribution of Third Party Software is in all respects subject to applicable license terms of applicable third party right holders.  5. PRE-RELEASE CODE  The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality marked or otherwise stated as \u201cTechnology Preview\u201d, \u201cAlpha\u201d, \u201cBeta\u201d or similar designation. Such pre-release code may be present in order to provide experimental support for new platforms or preliminary versions of one or more new functionalities. The pre-release code may not be at the level of performance and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering of the Licensed Software. The pre-release parts of the Licensed Software may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially modified by The Qt Company prior to the first commercial product release, if any. The Qt Company is under no obligation to make pre-release code commercially available, or provide any Support or Updates relating thereto. The Qt Company assumes no liability whatsoever regarding any pre-release code, but any use thereof is exclusively at Licensee\u2019s own risk and expense.  6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER  The Qt Company hereby represents and warrants that it has the power and authority to grant the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement.  Except as set forth above, the Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee \"as is\" and Licensee\u2019s exclusive remedy and The Qt Company\u2019s entire liability for errors in the Licensed Software shall be limited, at The Qt Company\u2019s option, to correction of the error, replacement of the Licensed Software or return of the applicable fees paid for the defective Licensed Software for the time period during which the License is not able to utilize the Licensed Software under the terms of this Agreement.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE QT COMPANY ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES, DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON- INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE. THE QT COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL SATISFY LICENSEE\u2019S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT IT WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DEFECT OR ERROR OR THAT THE OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. ALL USE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AT THE SOLE RISK OF AND RESPONSIBILITY OF LICENSEE.  7. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  7.1 Limitation of Liability  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR GOODWILL OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE COST, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND, HOWSOEVER ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. PARTIES SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT LICENSEE\u2019S OBLIGATION TO PAY LICENSE AND OTHER FEES CORRESPONDING TO ACTUAL USAGE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS A DIRECT DAMAGE.  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY\u2019S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE LICENSE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE TO THE QT COMPANY FROM LICENSEE DURING THE PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT RESULTING IN SUCH LIABILITY.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 7 ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE QT COMPANY AND LICENSEE AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED UPON THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  7.2 Licensee\u00b4s Indemnification  Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless The Qt Company from and against any claim, injury, judgment, settlement, loss or expense, including attorneys' fees related to: (a) Licensee\u2019s misrepresentation in connection with The Qt Company or the Licensed Software or breach of this Agreement, (b) the Application or Device (except where such cause of liability is solely attributable to the Licensed Software).  8. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES  Upon due payment of the agreed License Fees the Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use the Online Services during the License Term, provided, however, that in the event the License Term is longer than 36 months, Support is provided only for the first 12 months, unless the Parties specifically otherwise agree.  Unless otherwise decided by The Company at its free and absolute discretion, Upgrades will not be included in the Support but may be available subject to additional fees.  From time to time The Qt Company may change the Support terms, provided that during the respective ongoing License Term the level of Support provided by The Qt Company may not be reduced without the consent of the Licensee.  Unless otherwise agreed, The Qt Company shall not be responsible for providing any service or support to Customers.  9. CONFIDENTIALITY  Each Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may receive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d). Accordingly, when a Party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) receives Confidential Information from the other Party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own confidential and proprietary information.  Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the minimum extent necessary.  The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade secret laws.  10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT  10.1 License Fees  License Fees are described in The Qt Company\u2019s standard price list, quote or Purchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be.  The License Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or for any reason whatsoever.  10.2 Ordering Licenses  Licensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant to agreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon, at The Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.  Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable to The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a \u201cPurchase Order\u201d) for confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the Parties.  10.3 Distribution License Packs  Unless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of Distribution License Packs.  Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available for installing, bundling or integrating (all jointly \u201cinstalling\u201d) the Redistributables with the Devices or for otherwise distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this Agreement.  Each time Licensee \u201cinstalls\u201d or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution License is used, and Licensee\u2019s account of available Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.  Licensee may \u201cinstall\u201d copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.  Redistributables will be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d into a Device when one of the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables have been loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee\u2019s premises or b) the Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory (or sold) for the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use (or pay for) more than one Distribution License for each individual Device, e.g. in a situation where a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after delivery to a distributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee includes a back-up copy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage medium along with the product, that backup copy of the Redistributables will not be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d and will not require an additional Distribution License.  10.4 Payment Terms  License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice from The Qt Company.  The Qt Company will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this Agreement and/or after The Qt Company receives a Purchase Order from Licensee.  A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid balances that remain past due.  The Qt Company shall have the right to suspend, terminate or withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but not limited to the Developer License, Distribution License, and Support, should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion.  10.5 Taxes  All License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax and other taxes, duties or tariffs (\u201cTaxes\u201d). Such applicable Taxes shall be paid by Licensee, or, where applicable, in lieu of payment of such Taxes, Licensee shall provide an exemption certificate to The Qt Company and any applicable authority.  11 RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS  11.1 Licensee\u2019s Record-keeping  Licensee shall at all times maintain accurate and up-to-date written records of Licensee\u2019s activities related to the use of Licensed Software and distribution of Redistributables. The records shall be adequate to determine Licensee\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and to demonstrate the number of Designated Users and Redistributables distributed by Licensee. The records shall conform to good accounting practices reasonably acceptable to The Qt Company.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company\u2019s request to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report on Licensee\u2019s usage of Licensed Software, such report to copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, and also detailing the number of undistributed copies of Redistributables made by Licensee and remaining in its account contain information, in sufficient detail, on (i) amount of users working with Licensed Software, (ii) copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, (iii) number of undistributed copies of Redistributables and corresponding number of unused Distribution Licenses remaining on Licensee\u2019s account, and (iv) any other information as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to time.  11.2. The Qt Company\u2019s Audit Rights  The Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company\u2019s, may, upon at least five (5) business days\u2019 prior written notice and at its expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Redistributables, but not more frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee\u2019s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee\u2019s Records. All such Licensee\u2019s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.  If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee agrees to immediately pay The Qt Company any amounts owed for such unauthorized use.  In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (underpayment of more than 5% of License Fees shall always be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.  12 TERM AND TERMINATION  12.1 Term  This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and remain in force for as long as there is any Development License(s) in force (\u201cTerm\u201d), unless and until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.  12.2 Termination by The Qt Company  The Qt Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the Licensee is in material breach of any obligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice period.  12.3 Mutual Right to Terminate  Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice in the event that the other Party becomes insolvent, files for any form of bankruptcy, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a receiver, administrative receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a substantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent to any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other Party.  12.4 Parties\u00b4 Rights and Duties upon Termination  Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement Licensee shall cease and shall cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates\u2019 and Contractors\u2019) to cease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the Redistributables under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires or is terminated:  (i) as a result of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development License(s) as set forth in Section 3.1, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional licenses as set forth in Section 10.2; or  (ii) for reason other than by The Qt Company pursuant to item (i) above or pursuant to Section 12.2, then the Licensee is entitled, for a period of six (6) months after the effective date of termination, to continue distribution of Devices under the Distribution Licenses paid but unused at such effective date of termination.  Upon any such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Qt Company all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify the same to The Qt Company upon its request, provided however that Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may reasonably require in providing continued support to Customers.  Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Qt Company prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee shall immediately pay to The Qt Company all such fees upon the effective date of termination.  Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated Redistributables).  12.5 Extension in case of bankruptcy  In the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to party, who has assumed The Qt Company\u2019s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.  13. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL VENUE  In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Inc., a Delaware Corporation, then:  (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding its choice of law provisions;  (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and  (iii) any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, USA, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  14. GENERAL PROVISIONS  14.1 No Assignment  Except in the case of a merger or sale of substantially all of its corporate assets, Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of The Qt Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Qt Company shall be entitled to freely assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement.  14.2 No Third Party Representations  Licensee shall make no representations or warranties concerning the Licensed Software on behalf of The Qt Company. Any representation or warranty Licensee makes or purports to make on The Qt Company\u2019s behalf shall be void as to The Qt Company.  14.3 Surviving Sections  Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive termination of this Agreement shall so be deemed to survive.  14.4 Entire Agreement  This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the License Certificate and any applicable Purchase Order constitute the complete agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the subject matters discussed herein.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement will prevail over the terms of the Purchase Order with respect to such conflict or inconsistency.

If the Force Majeure Event results in a delay or non-performance of a Party for a period of three (3) months or longer, then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect without any liability (except for the obligations of payment arising prior to the event of Force Majeure) towards the other Party.  14.7 Notices  Any notice given by one Party to the other shall be deemed properly given and deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving Party in writing or when successfully delivered to the recipient by hand, fax, or special courier during normal business hours on a business day to the addresses specified for each Party on the signature page.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.

Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories.

Package: paramiko License: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License (LGPL) GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Suite 500, Boston, MA  02110-1335  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]  Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Suite 500, Boston, MA  02110-1335  USA  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice  That's all there is to it!

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Absent such written permission, any and all distribution by the Licensee during the Term of a hardware device or product a) which incorporate or integrate any part of Licensed Software or Open Source Qt; or b) where the main user interface or substantial functionality is provided by software build with Licensed Software or Open Source Qt or otherwise depends on the Licensed Software or Open Source Qt, shall be considered as a Device distribution under this Agreement and dependent on compliance thereof (including but not limited to obligation to pay applicable License Fees for such distribution);  (ix) Licensee shall cause all of its Affiliates and Contractors entitled to make use of the licenses granted under this Agreement, to be contractually bound to comply with the relevant terms of this Agreement and not to use the Licensed Software beyond the terms hereof and for any purposes other than operating within the scope of their services for Licensee. Licensee shall be responsible for any and all actions and omissions of its Affiliates and Contractors relating to the Licensed Software and use thereof (including but not limited to payment of all applicable License Fees);  (x) Except when and to the extent explicitly provided in this Section 3, Licensee shall not transfer, publish, disclose, display or otherwise make available the Licensed Software;  ; and  (xi) Licensee shall not attempt or enlist a third party to conduct or attempt to conduct any of the above.  Above terms shall not be applicable if and to the extent they conflict with any mandatory provisions of any applicable laws.  Any use of Licensed Software beyond the provisions of this Agreement is strictly prohibited and requires an additional license from The Qt Company.  4. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE  The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively \"Third Party Software\") to implement various functions. Third Party Software does not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Software may be included in the Licensed Software. Such Third Party Software will be listed in the \".../src/3rdparty\" source tree delivered with the Licensed Software or documented in the Licensed Software, as such may be amended from time to time. Licensee acknowledges that use or distribution of Third Party Software is in all respects subject to applicable license terms of applicable third party right holders.  5. PRE-RELEASE CODE  The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality marked or otherwise stated as \u201cTechnology Preview\u201d, \u201cAlpha\u201d, \u201cBeta\u201d or similar designation. Such pre-release code may be present in order to provide experimental support for new platforms or preliminary versions of one or more new functionalities. The pre-release code may not be at the level of performance and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering of the Licensed Software. The pre-release parts of the Licensed Software may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially modified by The Qt Company prior to the first commercial product release, if any. The Qt Company is under no obligation to make pre-release code commercially available, or provide any Support or Updates relating thereto. The Qt Company assumes no liability whatsoever regarding any pre-release code, but any use thereof is exclusively at Licensee\u2019s own risk and expense.  6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER  The Qt Company hereby represents and warrants that it has the power and authority to grant the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement.  Except as set forth above, the Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee \"as is\" and Licensee\u2019s exclusive remedy and The Qt Company\u2019s entire liability for errors in the Licensed Software shall be limited, at The Qt Company\u2019s option, to correction of the error, replacement of the Licensed Software or return of the applicable fees paid for the defective Licensed Software for the time period during which the License is not able to utilize the Licensed Software under the terms of this Agreement.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE QT COMPANY ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES, DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON- INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE. THE QT COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL SATISFY LICENSEE\u2019S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT IT WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DEFECT OR ERROR OR THAT THE OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. ALL USE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AT THE SOLE RISK OF AND RESPONSIBILITY OF LICENSEE.  7. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  7.1 Limitation of Liability  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR GOODWILL OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE COST, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND, HOWSOEVER ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. PARTIES SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT LICENSEE\u2019S OBLIGATION TO PAY LICENSE AND OTHER FEES CORRESPONDING TO ACTUAL USAGE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS A DIRECT DAMAGE.  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY\u2019S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE LICENSE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE TO THE QT COMPANY FROM LICENSEE DURING THE PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT RESULTING IN SUCH LIABILITY.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 7 ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE QT COMPANY AND LICENSEE AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED UPON THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  7.2 Licensee\u00b4s Indemnification  Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless The Qt Company from and against any claim, injury, judgment, settlement, loss or expense, including attorneys' fees related to: (a) Licensee\u2019s misrepresentation in connection with The Qt Company or the Licensed Software or breach of this Agreement, (b) the Application or Device (except where such cause of liability is solely attributable to the Licensed Software).  8. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES  Upon due payment of the agreed License Fees the Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use the Online Services during the License Term, provided, however, that in the event the License Term is longer than 36 months, Support is provided only for the first 12 months, unless the Parties specifically otherwise agree.  Unless otherwise decided by The Company at its free and absolute discretion, Upgrades will not be included in the Support but may be available subject to additional fees.  From time to time The Qt Company may change the Support terms, provided that during the respective ongoing License Term the level of Support provided by The Qt Company may not be reduced without the consent of the Licensee.  Unless otherwise agreed, The Qt Company shall not be responsible for providing any service or support to Customers.  9. CONFIDENTIALITY  Each Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may receive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d). Accordingly, when a Party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) receives Confidential Information from the other Party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own confidential and proprietary information.  Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the minimum extent necessary.  The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade secret laws.  10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT  10.1 License Fees  License Fees are described in The Qt Company\u2019s standard price list, quote or Purchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be.  The License Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or for any reason whatsoever.  10.2 Ordering Licenses  Licensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant to agreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon, at The Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.  Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable to The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a \u201cPurchase Order\u201d) for confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the Parties.  10.3 Distribution License Packs  Unless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of Distribution License Packs.  Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available for installing, bundling or integrating (all jointly \u201cinstalling\u201d) the Redistributables with the Devices or for otherwise distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this Agreement.  Each time Licensee \u201cinstalls\u201d or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution License is used, and Licensee\u2019s account of available Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.  Licensee may \u201cinstall\u201d copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.  Redistributables will be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d into a Device when one of the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables have been loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee\u2019s premises or b) the Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory (or sold) for the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use (or pay for) more than one Distribution License for each individual Device, e.g. in a situation where a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after delivery to a distributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee includes a back-up copy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage medium along with the product, that backup copy of the Redistributables will not be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d and will not require an additional Distribution License.  10.4 Payment Terms  License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice from The Qt Company.  The Qt Company will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this Agreement and/or after The Qt Company receives a Purchase Order from Licensee.  A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid balances that remain past due.  The Qt Company shall have the right to suspend, terminate or withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but not limited to the Developer License, Distribution License, and Support, should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion.  10.5 Taxes  All License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax and other taxes, duties or tariffs (\u201cTaxes\u201d). Such applicable Taxes shall be paid by Licensee, or, where applicable, in lieu of payment of such Taxes, Licensee shall provide an exemption certificate to The Qt Company and any applicable authority.  11 RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS  11.1 Licensee\u2019s Record-keeping  Licensee shall at all times maintain accurate and up-to-date written records of Licensee\u2019s activities related to the use of Licensed Software and distribution of Redistributables. The records shall be adequate to determine Licensee\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and to demonstrate the number of Designated Users and Redistributables distributed by Licensee. The records shall conform to good accounting practices reasonably acceptable to The Qt Company.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company\u2019s request to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report on Licensee\u2019s usage of Licensed Software, such report to copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, and also detailing the number of undistributed copies of Redistributables made by Licensee and remaining in its account contain information, in sufficient detail, on (i) amount of users working with Licensed Software, (ii) copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, (iii) number of undistributed copies of Redistributables and corresponding number of unused Distribution Licenses remaining on Licensee\u2019s account, and (iv) any other information as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to time.  11.2. The Qt Company\u2019s Audit Rights  The Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company\u2019s, may, upon at least five (5) business days\u2019 prior written notice and at its expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Redistributables, but not more frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee\u2019s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee\u2019s Records. All such Licensee\u2019s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.  If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee agrees to immediately pay The Qt Company any amounts owed for such unauthorized use.  In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (underpayment of more than 5% of License Fees shall always be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.  12 TERM AND TERMINATION  12.1 Term  This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and remain in force for as long as there is any Development License(s) in force (\u201cTerm\u201d), unless and until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.  12.2 Termination by The Qt Company  The Qt Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the Licensee is in material breach of any obligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice period.  12.3 Mutual Right to Terminate  Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice in the event that the other Party becomes insolvent, files for any form of bankruptcy, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a receiver, administrative receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a substantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent to any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other Party.  12.4 Parties\u00b4 Rights and Duties upon Termination  Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement Licensee shall cease and shall cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates\u2019 and Contractors\u2019) to cease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the Redistributables under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires or is terminated:  (i) as a result of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development License(s) as set forth in Section 3.1, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional licenses as set forth in Section 10.2; or  (ii) for reason other than by The Qt Company pursuant to item (i) above or pursuant to Section 12.2, then the Licensee is entitled, for a period of six (6) months after the effective date of termination, to continue distribution of Devices under the Distribution Licenses paid but unused at such effective date of termination.  Upon any such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Qt Company all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify the same to The Qt Company upon its request, provided however that Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may reasonably require in providing continued support to Customers.  Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Qt Company prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee shall immediately pay to The Qt Company all such fees upon the effective date of termination.  Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated Redistributables).  12.5 Extension in case of bankruptcy  In the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to party, who has assumed The Qt Company\u2019s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.  13. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL VENUE  In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Inc., a Delaware Corporation, then:  (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding its choice of law provisions;  (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and  (iii) any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, USA, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Ltd., a Finnish Company, then:  (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Finland, excluding its choice of law provisions;  (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and  (iii) any disputes, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of Finland Chamber of Commerce.

The award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be held in Helsinki, Finland and the process shall be conducted in the English language. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  14. GENERAL PROVISIONS  14.1 No Assignment  Except in the case of a merger or sale of substantially all of its corporate assets, Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of The Qt Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Qt Company shall be entitled to freely assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement.  14.2 No Third Party Representations  Licensee shall make no representations or warranties concerning the Licensed Software on behalf of The Qt Company. Any representation or warranty Licensee makes or purports to make on The Qt Company\u2019s behalf shall be void as to The Qt Company.  14.3 Surviving Sections  Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive termination of this Agreement shall so be deemed to survive.  14.4 Entire Agreement  This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the License Certificate and any applicable Purchase Order constitute the complete agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the subject matters discussed herein.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement will prevail over the terms of the Purchase Order with respect to such conflict or inconsistency.  Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that this Agreement prevails over any click-to-accept or similar agreements the Designated Users may need to accept online upon download of the Licensed Software, as may be required by The Qt Company\u2019s applicable processes relating to Licensed Software.  14.5 Modifications  No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless contained in a writing executed by an authorized representative of each Party. No term or condition contained in Licensee's Purchase Order shall apply unless expressly accepted by The Qt Company in writing.  14.6 Force Majeure  Except for the payment obligations hereunder, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any delay or non-performance of its obligations hereunder in the event and to the extent that such delay or non-performance is due to an event of act of God, terrorist attack or other similar unforeseeable catastrophic event that prevents either Party for fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and which such Party cannot avoid or circumvent (\u201cForce Majeure Event\u201d).  If the Force Majeure Event results in a delay or non-performance of a Party for a period of three (3) months or longer, then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect without any liability (except for the obligations of payment arising prior to the event of Force Majeure) towards the other Party.  14.7 Notices  Any notice given by one Party to the other shall be deemed properly given and deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving Party in writing or when successfully delivered to the recipient by hand, fax, or special courier during normal business hours on a business day to the addresses specified for each Party on the signature page. Each communication and document made or delivered by one Party to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be in the English language.  14.8 Export Control  Licensee acknowledges that the Redistributables may be subject to export control restrictions under the applicable laws of respective countries. Licensee shall fully comply with all applicable export license restrictions and requirements as well as with all laws and regulations relating to the Redistributables and exercise of licenses hereunder and shall procure all necessary governmental authorizations, including without limitation, all necessary licenses, approvals, permissions or consents, where necessary for the re-exportation of the Redistributables, Applications and/or Devices.  14.9 No Implied License  There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with The Qt Company and its licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the Licensed Software with any other software or hardware not delivered by The Qt Company under this Agreement.  14.10 Attorney Fees  The prevailing Party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with such action.  14.11 Severability  If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, have caused this Agreement to be executed by Licensee's authorized representative installing the Licensed Software and accepting the terms hereof in connection therewith.

Package: freetype License: GPL-2.0-only and LicenseRef-FreeType The FreeType Project LICENSE ----------------------------  2006-Jan-27  Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg    Introduction ============  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the FreeType Project.  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:  o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)  o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)  o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the FreeType code. (`credits')  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products. We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.   Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus encourage you to use the following text:  \"\"\" Portions of this software are copyright \u00c2\u00a9 <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved. \"\"\"  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.   Legal Terms ===========  0. Definitions --------------  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'. This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType engine'.  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive. If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as specified below.  1. No Warranty --------------  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.  2. Redistribution -----------------  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile, display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:  o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered, original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source files.  o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid to us.  3. Advertising --------------  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it. Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.  4. Contacts -----------  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:  o freetype@nongnu.org  Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution. If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.  o freetype-devel@nongnu.org  Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc.  Our home page can be found at  https://www.freetype.org  Package: frozenlist License: Apache Software License Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION  1.

This includes all of the IPython subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/ipython/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.

If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly the order listed) before diving into the code.   OVERVIEW ========  This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression.  JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing \"real-world\" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images, very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment with various compression settings.  This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.  We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications.  In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included \"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.  The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.  We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products. No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.   LEGAL ISSUES ============  In plain English:  1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!) 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us. 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.  In legalese:  The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided \"AS IS\", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.  This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.  Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group\". (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.  These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.  Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's software\".  We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.   ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.  The Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.  It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.  The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce \"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.  We are required to state that \"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.\"   REFERENCES ==========  We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to understand the innards of the JPEG software.  The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is Wallace, Gregory K.  \"The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard\", Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44. (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression, applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics) omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes.  A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in \"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here...  The best full description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG in existence, and we highly recommend it.  The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead; it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.) In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212) 642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of 1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7% shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.  Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3, a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.  The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format.  For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, revision 1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from: Literature Department C-Cube Microsystems, Inc. 1778 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314 A PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.  The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6). Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.   ARCHIVE LOCATIONS =================  The \"official\" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived as ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.  Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.  You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible \"zip\" archive format from the SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12 \"JPEG Tools\".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net release.  The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups. It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/ and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/. If you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with body send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2   RELATED SOFTWARE ================  Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to obtain them on Internet.  If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/. Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is; you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.  A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford, is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use; it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG, which we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)   FILE FORMAT WARS ================  Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library. The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a concrete file format.  Some vendors \"filled in the blanks\" on their own, creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to exchange compressed files.)  The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or \"low end\" representation. We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF Technical Note #2) for \"high end\" applications that need to record a lot of additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely supported, unfortunately.  The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF. SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not. (In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)  Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist. We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't use a proprietary file format!   TO DO =====  The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality. The current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be very good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary smoothing, \"poor man's variable quantization\", and other means of improving quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.  In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file format.  As always, speeding things up is of great interest.  Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5.

You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and  (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Package: sqlite License: Unlicense  SQLite Is Public Domain  All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. All contributors are citizens of countries that allow creative works to be dedicated into the public domain. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.  The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the \"configure\" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.  All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.  Open-Source, not Open-Contribution SQLite is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with those copies, without limitation. But SQLite is not open-contribution. In order to keep SQLite in the public domain and ensure that the code does not become contaminated with proprietary or licensed content, the project does not accept patches from people who have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution into the public domain.  All of the code in SQLite is original, having been written specifically for use by SQLite. No code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet.  Warranty of Title SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license. Even so, some organizations want legal proof of their right to use SQLite. Circumstances where this might occurs include the following:  Your company desires indemnity against claims of copyright infringement. You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the public domain. You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain. You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have the legal right to use and distribute SQLite. Your legal department tells you that you must purchase a license. If any of the above circumstances apply to you, Hwaci, the company that employs all the developers of SQLite, will sell you a Warranty of Title for SQLite. A Warranty of Title is a legal document that asserts that the claimed authors of SQLite are the true authors, and that the authors have the legal right to dedicate the SQLite to the public domain, and that Hwaci will vigorously defend against challenges to those claims. All proceeds from the sale of SQLite Warranties of Title are used to fund continuing improvement and support of SQLite.  Contributed Code In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, the project does not accept patches. If you would like to suggest a change and you include a patch as a proof-of-concept, that would be great. However, please do not be offended if we rewrite your patch from scratch.

This includes all of the IPython subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.  Package: typing-extensions License: Python Software Foundation License A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.  Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL- from                                compatible? (1)  0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes 1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes 1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no 2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no 1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2) 2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no 2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes 2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes 2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes 2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes 2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes  Footnotes:  (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.

Package: typing_extensions License: PSF-2.0  A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.  Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL- from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.   B.

You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Package: PyGithub License: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License (LGPL) GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  Preamble  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS  0. Definitions.  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  1. Source Code.  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.  2. Basic Permissions.  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.  7. Additional Terms.  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.  8. Termination.  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  11. Patents.  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.  14. Revised Versions of this License.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

Licensee acknowledges that use or distribution of Third Party Software is in all respects subject to applicable license terms of applicable third party right holders.  5. PRE-RELEASE CODE  The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality marked or otherwise stated as \u201cTechnology Preview\u201d, \u201cAlpha\u201d, \u201cBeta\u201d or similar designation. Such pre-release code may be present in order to provide experimental support for new platforms or preliminary versions of one or more new functionalities. The pre-release code may not be at the level of performance and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering of the Licensed Software. The pre-release parts of the Licensed Software may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially modified by The Qt Company prior to the first commercial product release, if any. The Qt Company is under no obligation to make pre-release code commercially available, or provide any Support or Updates relating thereto.

Except as set forth above, the Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee \"as is\" and Licensee\u2019s exclusive remedy and The Qt Company\u2019s entire liability for errors in the Licensed Software shall be limited, at The Qt Company\u2019s option, to correction of the error, replacement of the Licensed Software or return of the applicable fees paid for the defective Licensed Software for the time period during which the License is not able to utilize the Licensed Software under the terms of this Agreement.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE QT COMPANY ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES, DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON- INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 7 ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE QT COMPANY AND LICENSEE AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED UPON THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  7.2 Licensee\u00b4s Indemnification  Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless The Qt Company from and against any claim, injury, judgment, settlement, loss or expense, including attorneys' fees related to: (a) Licensee\u2019s misrepresentation in connection with The Qt Company or the Licensed Software or breach of this Agreement, (b) the Application or Device (except where such cause of liability is solely attributable to the Licensed Software).  8. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES  Upon due payment of the agreed License Fees the Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use the Online Services during the License Term, provided, however, that in the event the License Term is longer than 36 months, Support is provided only for the first 12 months, unless the Parties specifically otherwise agree.  Unless otherwise decided by The Company at its free and absolute discretion, Upgrades will not be included in the Support but may be available subject to additional fees.  From time to time The Qt Company may change the Support terms, provided that during the respective ongoing License Term the level of Support provided by The Qt Company may not be reduced without the consent of the Licensee.  Unless otherwise agreed, The Qt Company shall not be responsible for providing any service or support to Customers.  9. CONFIDENTIALITY  Each Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may receive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d). Accordingly, when a Party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) receives Confidential Information from the other Party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own confidential and proprietary information.  Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the minimum extent necessary.  The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade secret laws.  10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT  10.1 License Fees  License Fees are described in The Qt Company\u2019s standard price list, quote or Purchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be.  The License Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or for any reason whatsoever.  10.2 Ordering Licenses  Licensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant to agreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon, at The Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.  Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable to The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a \u201cPurchase Order\u201d) for confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the Parties.  10.3 Distribution License Packs  Unless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of Distribution License Packs.  Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available for installing, bundling or integrating (all jointly \u201cinstalling\u201d) the Redistributables with the Devices or for otherwise distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this Agreement.  Each time Licensee \u201cinstalls\u201d or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution License is used, and Licensee\u2019s account of available Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.  Licensee may \u201cinstall\u201d copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.  Redistributables will be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d into a Device when one of the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables have been loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee\u2019s premises or b) the Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory (or sold) for the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use (or pay for) more than one Distribution License for each individual Device, e.g. in a situation where a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after delivery to a distributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee includes a back-up copy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage medium along with the product, that backup copy of the Redistributables will not be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d and will not require an additional Distribution License.  10.4 Payment Terms  License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice from The Qt Company.  The Qt Company will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this Agreement and/or after The Qt Company receives a Purchase Order from Licensee.  A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid balances that remain past due.  The Qt Company shall have the right to suspend, terminate or withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but not limited to the Developer License, Distribution License, and Support, should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion.  10.5 Taxes  All License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax and other taxes, duties or tariffs (\u201cTaxes\u201d). Such applicable Taxes shall be paid by Licensee, or, where applicable, in lieu of payment of such Taxes, Licensee shall provide an exemption certificate to The Qt Company and any applicable authority.  11 RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS  11.1 Licensee\u2019s Record-keeping  Licensee shall at all times maintain accurate and up-to-date written records of Licensee\u2019s activities related to the use of Licensed Software and distribution of Redistributables. The records shall be adequate to determine Licensee\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and to demonstrate the number of Designated Users and Redistributables distributed by Licensee. The records shall conform to good accounting practices reasonably acceptable to The Qt Company.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company\u2019s request to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report on Licensee\u2019s usage of Licensed Software, such report to copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, and also detailing the number of undistributed copies of Redistributables made by Licensee and remaining in its account contain information, in sufficient detail, on (i) amount of users working with Licensed Software, (ii) copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, (iii) number of undistributed copies of Redistributables and corresponding number of unused Distribution Licenses remaining on Licensee\u2019s account, and (iv) any other information as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to time.  11.2. The Qt Company\u2019s Audit Rights  The Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company\u2019s, may, upon at least five (5) business days\u2019 prior written notice and at its expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Redistributables, but not more frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee\u2019s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee\u2019s Records. All such Licensee\u2019s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.  If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee agrees to immediately pay The Qt Company any amounts owed for such unauthorized use.  In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (underpayment of more than 5% of License Fees shall always be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.  12 TERM AND TERMINATION  12.1 Term  This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and remain in force for as long as there is any Development License(s) in force (\u201cTerm\u201d), unless and until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.  12.2 Termination by The Qt Company  The Qt Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the Licensee is in material breach of any obligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice period.  12.3 Mutual Right to Terminate  Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice in the event that the other Party becomes insolvent, files for any form of bankruptcy, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a receiver, administrative receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a substantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent to any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other Party.  12.4 Parties\u00b4 Rights and Duties upon Termination  Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement Licensee shall cease and shall cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates\u2019 and Contractors\u2019) to cease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the Redistributables under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires or is terminated:  (i) as a result of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development License(s) as set forth in Section 3.1, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional licenses as set forth in Section 10.2; or  (ii) for reason other than by The Qt Company pursuant to item (i) above or pursuant to Section 12.2, then the Licensee is entitled, for a period of six (6) months after the effective date of termination, to continue distribution of Devices under the Distribution Licenses paid but unused at such effective date of termination.  Upon any such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Qt Company all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify the same to The Qt Company upon its request, provided however that Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may reasonably require in providing continued support to Customers.

Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated Redistributables).  12.5 Extension in case of bankruptcy  In the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to party, who has assumed The Qt Company\u2019s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.  13.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  4.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.

You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.  NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Suite 500, Boston, MA  02110-1335  USA  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice  That's all there is to it!

Licensee may, at its sole and absolute discretion, choose to submit Modified Software to The Qt Company (\u201cSubmitted Modified Software\u201d) in connection with Licensee\u2019s Support request, service request or otherwise. In the event Licensee does so, then, Licensee hereby grants The Qt Company a sublicensable, assignable, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid-up license, under all of Licensee\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights, to reproduce, adapt, translate, modify, and prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, make available and distribute such Submitted Modified Software as The Qt Company sees fit at its free and absolute discretion.  3.

Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, Renewal Term shall be of equal length with the initial Term.

Absent such written permission, any and all distribution by the Licensee during the Term of a hardware device or product a) which incorporate or integrate any part of Licensed Software or Open Source Qt; or b) where the main user interface or substantial functionality is provided by software build with Licensed Software or Open Source Qt or otherwise depends on the Licensed Software or Open Source Qt, shall be considered as a Device distribution under this Agreement and dependent on compliance thereof (including but not limited to obligation to pay applicable License Fees for such distribution);  (ix) Licensee shall cause all of its Affiliates and Contractors entitled to make use of the licenses granted under this Agreement, to be contractually bound to comply with the relevant terms of this Agreement and not to use the Licensed Software beyond the terms hereof and for any purposes other than operating within the scope of their services for Licensee. Licensee shall be responsible for any and all actions and omissions of its Affiliates and Contractors relating to the Licensed Software and use thereof (including but not limited to payment of all applicable License Fees);  (x) Except when and to the extent explicitly provided in this Section 3, Licensee shall not transfer, publish, disclose, display or otherwise make available the Licensed Software;  ; and  (xi) Licensee shall not attempt or enlist a third party to conduct or attempt to conduct any of the above.  Above terms shall not be applicable if and to the extent they conflict with any mandatory provisions of any applicable laws.  Any use of Licensed Software beyond the provisions of this Agreement is strictly prohibited and requires an additional license from The Qt Company.  4. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE  The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively \"Third Party Software\") to implement various functions. Third Party Software does not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third Party Software may be included in the Licensed Software. Such Third Party Software will be listed in the \".../src/3rdparty\" source tree delivered with the Licensed Software or documented in the Licensed Software, as such may be amended from time to time. Licensee acknowledges that use or distribution of Third Party Software is in all respects subject to applicable license terms of applicable third party right holders.  5. PRE-RELEASE CODE  The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality marked or otherwise stated as \u201cTechnology Preview\u201d, \u201cAlpha\u201d, \u201cBeta\u201d or similar designation. Such pre-release code may be present in order to provide experimental support for new platforms or preliminary versions of one or more new functionalities. The pre-release code may not be at the level of performance and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering of the Licensed Software. The pre-release parts of the Licensed Software may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially modified by The Qt Company prior to the first commercial product release, if any. The Qt Company is under no obligation to make pre-release code commercially available, or provide any Support or Updates relating thereto. The Qt Company assumes no liability whatsoever regarding any pre-release code, but any use thereof is exclusively at Licensee\u2019s own risk and expense.  6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER  The Qt Company hereby represents and warrants that it has the power and authority to grant the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement.  Except as set forth above, the Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee \"as is\" and Licensee\u2019s exclusive remedy and The Qt Company\u2019s entire liability for errors in the Licensed Software shall be limited, at The Qt Company\u2019s option, to correction of the error, replacement of the Licensed Software or return of the applicable fees paid for the defective Licensed Software for the time period during which the License is not able to utilize the Licensed Software under the terms of this Agreement.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE QT COMPANY ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES, DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON- INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE. THE QT COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL SATISFY LICENSEE\u2019S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT IT WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DEFECT OR ERROR OR THAT THE OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. ALL USE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AT THE SOLE RISK OF AND RESPONSIBILITY OF LICENSEE.  7. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  7.1 Limitation of Liability  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR GOODWILL OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE COST, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND, HOWSOEVER ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. PARTIES SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT LICENSEE\u2019S OBLIGATION TO PAY LICENSE AND OTHER FEES CORRESPONDING TO ACTUAL USAGE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS A DIRECT DAMAGE.  EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY\u2019S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE LICENSE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE TO THE QT COMPANY FROM LICENSEE DURING THE PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT RESULTING IN SUCH LIABILITY.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 7 ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE QT COMPANY AND LICENSEE AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED UPON THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  7.2 Licensee\u00b4s Indemnification  Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless The Qt Company from and against any claim, injury, judgment, settlement, loss or expense, including attorneys' fees related to: (a) Licensee\u2019s misrepresentation in connection with The Qt Company or the Licensed Software or breach of this Agreement, (b) the Application or Device (except where such cause of liability is solely attributable to the Licensed Software).  8. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES  Upon due payment of the agreed License Fees the Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use the Online Services during the License Term, provided, however, that in the event the License Term is longer than 36 months, Support is provided only for the first 12 months, unless the Parties specifically otherwise agree.  Unless otherwise decided by The Company at its free and absolute discretion, Upgrades will not be included in the Support but may be available subject to additional fees.  From time to time The Qt Company may change the Support terms, provided that during the respective ongoing License Term the level of Support provided by The Qt Company may not be reduced without the consent of the Licensee.  Unless otherwise agreed, The Qt Company shall not be responsible for providing any service or support to Customers.  9. CONFIDENTIALITY  Each Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may receive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d). Accordingly, when a Party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) receives Confidential Information from the other Party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own confidential and proprietary information.  Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the minimum extent necessary.  The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade secret laws.  10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT  10.1 License Fees  License Fees are described in The Qt Company\u2019s standard price list, quote or Purchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be.  The License Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or for any reason whatsoever.  10.2 Ordering Licenses  Licensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant to agreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon, at The Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.  Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable to The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a \u201cPurchase Order\u201d) for confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the Parties.  10.3 Distribution License Packs  Unless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of Distribution License Packs.  Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available for installing, bundling or integrating (all jointly \u201cinstalling\u201d) the Redistributables with the Devices or for otherwise distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this Agreement.  Each time Licensee \u201cinstalls\u201d or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution License is used, and Licensee\u2019s account of available Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.  Licensee may \u201cinstall\u201d copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.  Redistributables will be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d into a Device when one of the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables have been loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee\u2019s premises or b) the Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory (or sold) for the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use (or pay for) more than one Distribution License for each individual Device, e.g. in a situation where a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after delivery to a distributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee includes a back-up copy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage medium along with the product, that backup copy of the Redistributables will not be deemed to have been \u201cinstalled\u201d and will not require an additional Distribution License.  10.4 Payment Terms  License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice from The Qt Company.  The Qt Company will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this Agreement and/or after The Qt Company receives a Purchase Order from Licensee.  A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid balances that remain past due.  The Qt Company shall have the right to suspend, terminate or withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but not limited to the Developer License, Distribution License, and Support, should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion.  10.5 Taxes  All License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax and other taxes, duties or tariffs (\u201cTaxes\u201d). Such applicable Taxes shall be paid by Licensee, or, where applicable, in lieu of payment of such Taxes, Licensee shall provide an exemption certificate to The Qt Company and any applicable authority.  11 RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS  11.1 Licensee\u2019s Record-keeping  Licensee shall at all times maintain accurate and up-to-date written records of Licensee\u2019s activities related to the use of Licensed Software and distribution of Redistributables. The records shall be adequate to determine Licensee\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and to demonstrate the number of Designated Users and Redistributables distributed by Licensee. The records shall conform to good accounting practices reasonably acceptable to The Qt Company.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company\u2019s request to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report on Licensee\u2019s usage of Licensed Software, such report to copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, and also detailing the number of undistributed copies of Redistributables made by Licensee and remaining in its account contain information, in sufficient detail, on (i) amount of users working with Licensed Software, (ii) copies of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, (iii) number of undistributed copies of Redistributables and corresponding number of unused Distribution Licenses remaining on Licensee\u2019s account, and (iv) any other information as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to time.  11.2. The Qt Company\u2019s Audit Rights  The Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company\u2019s, may, upon at least five (5) business days\u2019 prior written notice and at its expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Redistributables, but not more frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee\u2019s place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee\u2019s Records. All such Licensee\u2019s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.  If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee agrees to immediately pay The Qt Company any amounts owed for such unauthorized use.  In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (underpayment of more than 5% of License Fees shall always be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.  12 TERM AND TERMINATION  12.1 Term  This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and remain in force for as long as there is any Development License(s) in force (\u201cTerm\u201d), unless and until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.  12.2 Termination by The Qt Company  The Qt Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the Licensee is in material breach of any obligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice period.  12.3 Mutual Right to Terminate  Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice in the event that the other Party becomes insolvent, files for any form of bankruptcy, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a receiver, administrative receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a substantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act equivalent to any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the other Party.  12.4 Parties\u00b4 Rights and Duties upon Termination  Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement Licensee shall cease and shall cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates\u2019 and Contractors\u2019) to cease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the Redistributables under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires or is terminated:  (i) as a result of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development License(s) as set forth in Section 3.1, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional licenses as set forth in Section 10.2; or  (ii) for reason other than by The Qt Company pursuant to item (i) above or pursuant to Section 12.2, then the Licensee is entitled, for a period of six (6) months after the effective date of termination, to continue distribution of Devices under the Distribution Licenses paid but unused at such effective date of termination.  Upon any such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Qt Company all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify the same to The Qt Company upon its request, provided however that Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may reasonably require in providing continued support to Customers.  Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Qt Company prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee shall immediately pay to The Qt Company all such fees upon the effective date of termination.  Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated Redistributables).  12.5 Extension in case of bankruptcy  In the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to party, who has assumed The Qt Company\u2019s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.  13. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL VENUE  In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Inc., a Delaware Corporation, then:  (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding its choice of law provisions;  (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and  (iii) any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, USA, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Ltd., a Finnish Company, then:  (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Finland, excluding its choice of law provisions;  (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and  (iii) any disputes, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of Finland Chamber of Commerce.

This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  14. GENERAL PROVISIONS  14.1 No Assignment  Except in the case of a merger or sale of substantially all of its corporate assets, Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of The Qt Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Qt Company shall be entitled to freely assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement.  14.2 No Third Party Representations  Licensee shall make no representations or warranties concerning the Licensed Software on behalf of The Qt Company. Any representation or warranty Licensee makes or purports to make on The Qt Company\u2019s behalf shall be void as to The Qt Company.  14.3 Surviving Sections  Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive termination of this Agreement shall so be deemed to survive.  14.4 Entire Agreement  This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the License Certificate and any applicable Purchase Order constitute the complete agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the subject matters discussed herein.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement will prevail over the terms of the Purchase Order with respect to such conflict or inconsistency.

If the Force Majeure Event results in a delay or non-performance of a Party for a period of three (3) months or longer, then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect without any liability (except for the obligations of payment arising prior to the event of Force Majeure) towards the other Party.  14.7 Notices  Any notice given by one Party to the other shall be deemed properly given and deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving Party in writing or when successfully delivered to the recipient by hand, fax, or special courier during normal business hours on a business day to the addresses specified for each Party on the signature page.
