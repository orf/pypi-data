            "description": "``audio-feeder`` is a Flask-based web-app that hosts your audiobooks (or other audio content) as RSS feeds compatible with podcatchers.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nThe main interface lists all your audiobooks once the database is updated (either by using ``audio-feeder update`` or by visiting the ``/update`` url. The default interface should also work well on mobile:\n\nRendered feeds\n**************\nFor each entry, ``audio-feeder`` can also generate \"rendered\" feeds, depending on what metadata is available:\n\n- Single file: This feed consists of a single file; if the original directory contains multiple files, they will be merged together using ``ffmpeg``. If chapter information is not available in the original files, each file will be considered a separate \"chapter\".\n\n- Chapters: This feed has one file per chapter; it is only available if explicit chapter metadata is available in the file (e.g. in an ``m4b`` file, or using Overdrive MediaMarkers).\n\n- Segmented: This is a feed that splits up and recombines files in such a way as to create files that are ~1 hour long (preferring longer files to shorter files). Files will only be split up along chapter boundaries, but they can be combined from files without chapter information. This mode is available if the original entry has more than one file, or if it has chapter information (or both).\n\nQR Codes\n********\n\nEach feed has an associated QR code, so that you can easily browse the list from a computer, but scan the individual feeds from your phone. In the default front-end, QR codes are displayed via modal pop-ups:\n\nDisplay options\n***************\n\nThe user can customize things like the sort order and the number of entries per page:\n\nInstallation and use\n====================\n\nProbably the easiest way to deploy this is via docker. For your convenience, I have created `a repository with a docker-compose configuration <https://github.com/pganssle/audio_feeder_docker>`_. It uses ``nginx`` to serve static media files, and ``gunicorn`` to deploy the application.\n\nIf you want to test it out locally, you can use ``tox -e start_server`` to run a test server. This will create a temporary server directory at ``/tmp/audio_feeder_server``, and you can play around with, and you can mount your audiobook directory at ``/tmp/audio_feeder_server/static/media`` to have it work on your own audiobooks (bind mount, symlink or hard link should work just fine).\n\nIn a ``virtualenv`` with ``audio-feeder`` installed, you can run ``audio-feeder --help`` to see the various command line tools bundled with the application.\n\nNote\n=====\n\nWhile the state of this is getting much closer to something production-ready, I am emphatically *not* a front-end developer, and I don't have extremely high confidence in the security of this project. Use at your own risk (and if you do come up with some security and/or usability improvements, please do send a PR).\n\nThis is only tested on Linux, but it may also work on other platforms.\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nIn addition to the python dependencies specified in ``pyproject.toml``, this project also requires installing ``ffmpeg`` with at least the ``aac`` codec, and the tests also require the ``libmp3lame`` codec.\n\nLicense\n=======\nAll images and documentation contained herein are licensed under `CC-0 <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>`_.\n\nThe code is released under the `Apache 2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ license.\n\nContributing\n============\nPull requests and issues are more than welcome.
