            "description": "# IbPy - Interactive Brokers Python API\n\nIbPy Released 15 Jun 2013\n\n## What is IbPy?\n\nIbPy is a third-party implementation of the API used for accessing the\nInteractive Brokers on-line trading system. IbPy implements\nfunctionality that the Python programmer can use to connect to IB,\nrequest stock ticker data, submit orders for stocks and futures, and\nmore.\n\n## What's new in this release?\n\n   -  TWS API version 9.70 now supported\n   -  Over 60% test coverage and growing\n   -  Fixed outstanding bugs in EReader generated source\n   -  Module ib.opt.logger moved to ib.lib.logger\n   -  Class ib.opt.Connection moved to new ib.opt.connection module\n   -  Added script to filter TWS log files; see demo/log_filter\n   -  Added ib.sym package to hold various symbolic constants\n   -  Many small enhancements to ib.opt package\n\n# Where can I get IbPy?\n\nGitHub:\n\n   https://github.com/blampe/IbPy\n\nOlder versions of IbPy are available for download from Google Code:\n\n   https://code.google.com/p/ibpy/downloads/list\n\nProject page:\n\n   http://code.google.com/p/ibpy/\n\n# How do I use IbPy?\n\nSee the IbPy wiki page \"Getting Started with IbPy\":\n\n   http://code.google.com/p/ibpy/wiki/GettingStarted\n\n# What are the requirements?\n\nIbPy requires Python 2.5 or newer. Previous versions are not supported.\n\nTWS requires a web browser capable of executing Sun(R) Java(tm) applets.\nTWS can also be started directly with Sun(R) Java(tm) and the\nstand-alone package supplied by Interactive Brokers.\n\n# What is Interactive Brokers?\n\nFrom the page \"About The Interactive Brokers Group\" [2]:\n\n> Interactive Brokers conducts its broker/dealer and proprietary trading\n> businesses on 60 market centers worldwide. In its broker dealer agency\n> business, IB provides direct access (\"on line\") trade execution and\nclearing > services to institutional and professional traders for a wide\nvariety of > electronically traded products including options, futures,\nstocks, forex, and > bonds worldwide. In its proprietary trading\nbusiness IB engages in market > making for its own account in about\n6,500 different electronically traded > products. Interactive Brokers\nGroup and its affiliates now trade 19% of the > world\u2019s exchange traded\nequity options, and executes approximately 500,000 > trades per day.\n\n# What is Python?\n\nFrom the page \"What is Python?\" [1]:\n\n> Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming\nlanguage. > It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.\n\n> Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has\nmodules, > classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and\ndynamic typing. > There are interfaces to many system calls and\nlibraries, as well as to > various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,\nMac, MFC). New built-in modules > are easily written in C or C++. Python\nis also usable as an extension > language for applications that need a\nprogrammable interface.\n\n> The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX,\non > Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system isn't\nlisted here, > it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for\nit. Ask around on > comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python\nyourself.\n\n> The Python implementation is copyrighted but freely usable and\ndistributable, > even for commercial use.\n\n# What Else?\n\nIbPy is not a product of Interactive Brokers, nor is this project\naffiliated with IB.\n\nIbPy is installed with distutils. Refer to the Python distutils\ndocumentation for more information. The digest version is:\n\n   $ tar xzf IbPy-0.8.0-9.67.tar.gz $ cd :release_root: $ python\n   setup.py install\n\nThe TWS demo system is available here:\n\n   http://interactivebrokers.com/cgi-pub/jtslink.pl?user_name=edemo\n\nThe stand-alone TWS and other API software is available from IB:\n\n   http://interactivebrokers.com/\n\nIbPy is distributed under the New BSD License. See the LICENSE file in\nthe release for details.\n\nI'm very interested in your experience with IbPy. Please drop me an note\nwith any feedback you have.\n\nTroy Melhase\n\n[1]: http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/general/about/about.php [2]:\nhttp://python.org/doc/Summary.html\n",
