We highly encourage you to go over the tutorial hand in hand with the [official docs](https://wave.h2o.ai/) to get the most information possible.\n\nEach lesson explains a single topic and shows a short demonstration example. The example code is editable and we highly encourage playing around with it and doing your experiments to see how things work. Moreover, most of the lessons also contain a small optional exercise for you to reinforce the newly acquired knowledge.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\npip install h2o-wave-university\nwave-university\n```\n\nOnce both of the above steps are complete, you can go to <http://localhost:10101> in your favorite browser to start learning!\n\n\n",
