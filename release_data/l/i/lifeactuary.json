            "description": "# lifeactuary\nPackage *lifeactuary* is a Python library to perform actuarial mathematics on life contingencies and classical financial mathematics computations. Versatile, simple and easy to use. The main functions are implemented using the usual actuarial approach, making it a natural choice for the life actuary.\nThis document is produced as a descriptive tool on how to use the package and as a user guide for the developed actuarial functions. For each actuarial function, an illustrative example is provided. \n        \nThe package uses Python version >= 3.6.\n\nThis package and functions herein are provided as is, without any guarantee regarding the accuracy of calculations. It's distributed using the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) and the authors disclaim any liability arising by any losses due to direct or indirect use of this package.\n\n    \nThis package is still under development and further useful and interesting functions will be available any time soon.\n\nYou should also visit [lifeactuary at github](https://github.com/parcr/lifeactuary) to download the folder *\"soa_tables\"* containing a set of tables, namely the ones used in the examples in the manual.",
