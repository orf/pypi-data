It takes a video or an audio file as input, \nperforms voice activity detection to find speech regions, makes parallel requests to Google Web Speech API to generate \ntranscriptions for those regions, (optionally) translates them to a different language, and finally saves the resulting \nsubtitles to disk. It supports a variety of input and output languages (to see which, run the utility with --list-languages \nas argument respectively) and can currently produce subtitles in SRT format.\n\nthis script is a modified and combined version of original autosub made by Anastasis Germanidis at https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub\nand translate-srt-subtitles.py made by jaredyam at https://gist.github.com/jaredyam/4fe7527ccf6981595a879c9705e56c51\n\n### Installation\n\nif you don't have python on your system you can get compiled version from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YVi7E2iY28SZc5k0R52OVDubCOCYTk8e/view?usp=sharing\n\nin Windows just extract those ffmpeg.exe and autosrt.exe (in this rar windows folder) into a folder that has been added to PATH ENVIRONTMET\nfor example in C:\\Windows\\system32\n\nyou can get original ffmpeg from https://www.ffmpeg.org/\n\nmake sure ffmpeg.exe can be reached from any folder by adding its location folder into PATH ENVIRONTMENT\n\nin Linux you're still need ffmpeg, so install it first then extract autosrt file (from this rar linux folder) into \n/usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/ or /usr/sbin/ or /usr/local/sbin/\n\n\nif python has already installed on your system you can install this script with pip\n\n```\npip install ffmpeg\npip install autosrt\n```\n\nyou can compile this script into a single executable file with pyinstaller by downloading\n```__init__.py``` file, rename it to ```autosrt.py``` and type :\n\n```\npip install pyinstaller\npyinstaller --onefile autosrt.py\n```\n\nthe executable compiled file will be placed by pyinstaller into dist subfolder of your current working folder, then you can \njust rename and put that compiled file into a folder that has been added to your PATH ENVIRONTMENT so you can execute it from anywhere\n\nI was succesfuly compiled it in Windows 10 with pyinstaller-5.1 and Pyhton-3.10.4, and python-3.8.12 in Debian 9\n\nother alternative way you can install this script with python by cloning this git (or downloading this git as zip then extract it into \na folder), and then just type :\n\n```\npython setup.py build\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nSimple usage example :\n  \n```\nautosrt --list-languages\nautosrt -S zh-CN -D en filename.mp4\n```  \n\n### Usage\n\n```\nautosrt [-h] [-C CONCURRENCY] [-o OUTPUT] [-F FORMAT] [-S SRC_LANGUAGE] [-D DST_LANGUAGE]\n             [-n RENAME] [-p PATIENCE] [-v] [--list-formats] [--list-languages] [source_path]\n\npositional arguments:\n  source_path           Path to the video or audio file to subtitle\n\noptions:\n\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  \n  -C CONCURRENCY, --concurrency CONCURRENCY\n                        Number of concurrent API requests to make\n                        \n  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT\n                        Output path for subtitles (by default, subtitles are saved in the same directory \n                        and name as the source path)\n                        \n  -F FORMAT, --format FORMAT\n                        Destination subtitle format\n                        \n  -S SRC_LANGUAGE, --src-language SRC_LANGUAGE\n                        Language spoken in source file\n                        \n  -D DST_LANGUAGE, --dst-language DST_LANGUAGE\n                        Desired language for the subtitles\n                        \n  -n RENAME, --rename RENAME\n                        rename the output file.\n                        \n  -p PATIENCE, --patience PATIENCE\n                        the patience of retrying to translate.
