Files are JSON dumps\nthat are read-only so thus should provide (disk) persistence. Paths carry the\ntype in the path name what makes reconstruction from filename easier then\nreading type from the object.\n\n\n**CONFIGURATION**\n\n``cmdz`` looks for it's modules in ~/.cmdz/mod. A collection of sample modules \ncan be found in /usr/local/cmdz/mod. Copy what modules you want to ~/.cmdz/mod,\nor write your own modules and put them in ~/.cmdz/mod. \n\n\n**PROGRAMMING**\n\n\nThe ``cmdz`` package provides an Object class, that mimics a dict while using\nattribute access and provides a save/load to/from json files on disk.\nObjects can be searched with database functions and uses read-only files\nto improve persistence and a type in filename for reconstruction. Methods are\nfactored out into functions to have a clean namespace to read JSON data into.\n\nbasic usage is this::\n\n>>> import cmdz\n>>> o = cmdz.Object()\n>>> o.key = \"value\"\n>>> o.key\n>>> 'value'\n\nObjects try to mimic a dictionary while trying to be an object with normal\nattribute access as well. hidden methods are provided, the methods are\nfactored out into functions like get, items, keys, register, set, update\nand values.\n\nload/save from/to disk::\n\n>>> from cmdz import Object, load, save\n>>> o = Object()\n>>> o.key = \"value\"\n>>> p = save(o)\n>>> obj = Object()\n>>> load(obj, p)\n>>> obj.key\n>>> 'value'\n\ngreat for giving objects peristence by having their state stored in files::\n\n>>> from cmdz import Object, save\n>>> o = Object()\n>>> save(o)\n>>> 'cmdz.Object/c13c5369-8ada-44a9-80b3-4641986f09df/2021-08-31/15:31:05.717063'\n\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n\nB.H.J. Thate\n\n\n**COPYRIGHT**\n\n``CMDZ`` is placed in the Public Domain.\n\n\n",
