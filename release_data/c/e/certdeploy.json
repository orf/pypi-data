The \"server\". Which is implemented as a deploy hook for certbot and a docker container that bundles the deploy hook with certbot.\n1. The \"client\". Which when run as a script moves certs from a staging directory to another directory, updates services after it moves the certs and can be run via cron or systemd timer and the \"client\" daemon which also runs an SFTP server that the CertDepoly server can connect to directly.\n\nThis tool can be used in a few different ways:\n* As a set of docker containers automatically renewing and distributing certs then updating docker services and restarting docker containers via the Docker API.\n* As scripts embeded in regular linux systems.\n* As a mix of both.\n\n\n## The Server\nThere are three parts to the server.\n1. The certbot hook, which is run by Certbot as a deploy hook.\n1. The command, which can be used to push certs to clients directly or try to renew certs immediately. This is useful for testing setups.\n1. The daemon, which runs ``certbot renew`` on an interval (and indirectly ``certdeploy-server`` as a hook when certs are renewed). This is optional, but is the default in the server docker container.\n\n### Commandline Options for the command/daemon\n* `--lineage` - The path of a lineage (eg `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com`). This is mutually exclusive with `--daemon`.\n* `--domains` - A space separated list of domains as a single string (eg `\"www.example.com example.com\"`). This is mutually exclusive with `--daemon`.\n* `--config` - The path to the config file.\n* `--daemon` - Run the daemon. Without this option the server command will run once and exit.\n* `--renew` - Run the cert renewal part of the daemon once and exit.\n* `--log-level` - Set the log level to `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`.\n\n#### Examples\nTo run these in the running docker container prefix the commands with `docker container exec <container name>`.\n* Run the daemon with a custom config file location and log level.\n    ```\n    certdeploy-server --daemon --config /path/to/server.yml --log-level INFO\n    ```\n* Run the command to force deploying certs. Where `/etc/letsencrypt/live/` is the path to the lineages. Certbot puts it there by default. The server script can only handle one lineage at a time.\n    ```\n    certdeploy-server --lineage /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com --domains \"www.example.com example.com\"\n    ```\n* Run the command to try to renew certs.\n    ```\n    certdeploy-server --renew\n    ```\n\n### Enviroment Variables\nCommandline options override environment variables.\n* ``CERTDEPLOY_RENEW_ONLY`` - If set to `true` it is the equivalent of ``--renew``.\n* ``CERTDEPLOY_SERVER_DAEMON`` - If set to `true` it is the equivalent of ``--daemon``.\n* ``CERTDEPLOY_SERVER_CONFIG`` - The path to the server config file. Equivalent to ``--config``.\n* ``CERTDEPLOY_LOG_LEVEL`` - The log level. Equivalent to ``--log-level``.\n\n#### Hook Environment Variables\nThe hook (``certdeploy-server`` when it's run by Certbot) expects the following environmental variables from Certbot in addition to the optional ``CERTDEPLOY_SERVER_CONFIG`` and ``CERTDEPLOY_LOG_LEVEL`` as described above.\n* ``RENEWED_LINEAGE`` - The \"lineage\" or path to the renewed certs.\n* ``RENEWED_DOMAINS`` - A space separated list of domains associated to the renewed certs.\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Server Settings\n* `client_configs` - A list of [client connection settings](#client-connection-settings).\n* `privkey_filename` - The path to the CertDeploy server private key file.\n* `fail_fast` (optional) - Stop on the first failed action. Defaults to `false`.\n* `log_level` (optional) - The logging level. Options are ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``, ``CRITICAL``. Defaults to ``ERROR``.\n\nThe following are daemon specific configs.\n* `renew_every` (optional) - The interval count to multiply `renew_unit` by. This must be a positive integer. The default is 1.\n* `renew_unit` (optional) - The interval unit to check for new certs. This can be `minute`, `day`, `week`, or a weekday. Defaults to `day`.\n* `renew_at` (optional) - The time of day to check for new certs. Formatted ``HH:MM``. Defaults to ``null`` which is equivalent to the current time.\n* `renew_exec` (optional) - The path of the `certbot` executable. If for some reason `certbot` isn't in the `$PATH` this lets the full path be given. This is also useful for testing. The `tests/docker/mock/mock-certbot.sh` script in the repository can be mounted in the container and the path given with this option. That way settings can be tested without spamming [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).\n* `renew_args` (optional) - A list of arguments to pass to `certbot` when attempting to renew certs. Defaults to ``['renew']``.\n\n##### Scheduling Examples\n* The default behavior is to try to renew once a day which is equivalent to the following.\n    ```yaml\n    renew_every: 1\n    renew_unit: day\n    renew_at: null\n    ```\n* To try to renew certs every other day at 3pm use the following.\n    ```yaml\n    renew_every: 2\n    # `day` is the default for `renew_unit` so this can be left out if you want.\n    renew_unit: day\n    renew_at: 15:00\n    ```\n* To try to renew certs every Monday and you don't care about the time use the following.\n    ```yaml\n    renew_unit: monday\n    ```\n\n#### Client Connection Settings\n* `address` - The client address (IP address or hostname).\n* `domains` - A list of domains that this client needs certs for.\n* `port` (optional) - The remote port of either an ssh server on the client or the CertDeploy client. Defaults to 22.\n* `username` (optional) - The remote username to login to the ssh server or CertDeploy client with. Defaults to `certdeploy`.\n* `pubkey` (optional) - The text of the client's public key. If the client is a regular SSH server remember to grab the SSH server's pubkey not the user's pubkey.\n* `path` (optional) - The directory on the remote system where the CertDeploy client will look for new certs. Defaults to `/var/cache/certdeploy`. If set to ``null`` or an empty string the base path for the client will be used. This will be the configured `source` path on the client daemon or the home directory if the client is relying on the host system for SFTP.  This directory should only be readable by the CertDeploy user on the client since it will have TLS certs hanging around.\n* `needs_chain` (optional) - If this is `true` the `chain.pem` from the relevant lineages will be copied to this client. Defaults to `false`.\n* `needs_fullchain` (optional) - If this is `true` the `fullchain.pem` from the relevant lineages will be copied to this client. Defaults to `true`.\n* `needs_privkey` (optional) - If this is `true` the `privkey.pem` from the relevant lineages will be copied to this client. Defaults to `true`.\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Simple\nA single client and private key. This will work in any of the server modes.\n```yaml\n---\nprivkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/server_key\nclient_configs:\n  - address: 1.2.3.4\n    pubkey: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIP+H3Nk/9uSa7LHNt8fvCPKKkNFnVE5SGC5tnthf6/OK\n    domains:\n      - example.com\n```\n\n##### Daemon\nThis can be given to `certdeploy-server` along with the `--daemon` option or as part of the docker image to run `certbot renew` every Monday at 9:00AM and deploy new certs for `example.com` to `1.2.3.4`.\n```yaml\n---\nprivkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/server_key\ncheck_renew:\n  every: monday\n  at: 09:00\nclient_configs:\n  - address: 1.2.3.4\n    pubkey: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIP+H3Nk/9uSa7LHNt8fvCPKKkNFnVE5SGC5tnthf6/OK\n    domains:\n      - example.com\n```\n\n#### Server Security Considerations\nWhen run as a script (`--renew`) or daemon outside of docker it's expected that the CertDeploy server will run as root or a user that has permission to run Certbot to run ``certbot renew``. Because it can run arbitrary code (via the `renew_exec` and `renew_args` configs) and distributes your TLS certs, it is very strongly recommended that the config file is globally read only or readable only by the user running the server, and writable only by root or at most only by the user that runs the server.\n\n### Installation\nThe recommended way to use the server is to have it running in a docker container. This image has Certbot baked in and automatically runs `certbot renew` on a schedule.\n\n#### Docker\n1. Create a directory to put the configs in and enter it. For example `mkdir conf && cd conf`.\n1. Generate server key pair `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f server_key` Don't enter a password. CertDeploy doesn't support password files.\n1. Create a `server.yml` with the clients. For now we'll assume you have the pubkey for the first client.\n    ```yaml\n    ---\n    private_key_file: /etc/certdeploy/server_key\n    client_configs:\n      - address: <your client ip or hostname>\n        pubkey: <your client's pubkey without the comment>\n        domains:\n          - <the domain name that this client needs certs for>\n    check_renew:\n      every: week\n    ```\n1. Install the docker container.\n    ```\n    docker run -d -v $(pwd)/conf:/etc/certdeploy -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt haxwithaxe/certdeploy-server\n    ```\n    Where ``./conf`` is a directory with a ``server.yml`` and an ED25519 key pair. If you don't see anything in the logs it's probably working fine. The default log level isn't verbose. You can add ``--env 'LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG'`` to get the firehose of output if you want to be certian it's working.\n\n    Or with docker-compose with the following:\n    ```yaml\n    ---\n    version: \"3\"\n\n    services:\n      certdeploy-server:\n        image: haxwithaxe/certdeploy-server\n        volumes:\n          - \"./conf:/etc/certdeploy\"\n          - \"/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt\"\n    ```\n\n#### Install in an existing system\n1. Create a directory to put the configs in and enter it. For example `sudo mkdir /etc/certdeploy && cd /etc/certdeploy`.\n1. Generate server key pair `sudo ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f server_key` Don't enter a password. CertDeploy doesn't support password files.\n1. Create a `server.yml` with the clients. For now we'll assume you have the pubkey for the first client.\n    ```yaml\n    ---\n    private_key_file: /etc/certdeploy/server_key\n    client_configs:\n      - address: <your client ip or hostname>\n        pubkey: <your client's pubkey without the comment>\n        domains:\n          - <the domain name that this client needs certs for>\n    check_renew:\n      every: week\n    ```\n1. Install CertDeploy `sudo pip install certdeploy`.\n1. Install the CertDeploy CertBot hook.\n    ```\n    sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/certdeploy-server /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/certdeploy-hook\n    ```\n\n## The Client\n\n### Commandline Options\n* `--config` - The path to the config file.\n* `--daemon` - Run the daemon. Without this option the sync and update actions will run once and quit.\n* `--log-level` - Set the log level to `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`.\n\n### Environment Variables\nCommandline options override environment variables.\n* ``CERTDEPLOY_CLIENT_DAEMON`` - If set to `true` it is the equivalent of ``--daemon``.\n* ``CERTDEPLOY_CLIENT_CONFIG`` - The path to the client config file. Equivalent to ``--config``.\n* ``CERTDEPLOY_LOG_LEVEL`` - The log level. Equivalent to ``--log-level``.\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### Generate client keypair\n``ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f client_key`` Don't enter a password. CertDeploy doesn't support password files.\n\n#### Client settings\n* `destination` - The path to dump the certs in. The certs will be placed in \"lineage\" directories within this directory as seen in ``/etc/letsencrypt/live`` in a certbot installation.\n* `source` (optional) - The directory the server uploads the certs to. Defaults to ``/var/cache/certdeploy``.\n* `sftpd` (optional) - The SFTP server settings. See below.\n* `systemd_exec` (optional) - The path to the `systemctl` executable for restarting/reloading systemd units.\n* `systemd_timeout` (optional) - The timeout in seconds for executing systemctl commands. Defaults to `null` (wait indefinitely).\n* `docker_url` (optional) - The URL to the Docker API. Defaults to the local socket location.\n* `update_sevices` - A list of definitions of services to reload/restart/run after deploying the certs.\n\n##### Service Definitions\nEach definition has a ``type`` key and one or more other keys. They are run in the order they are written in the config.\n* Docker swarm services have a type of ``docker_service`` and can have a `name` key with a string value or a `filters` key with a dictionary of filters. See [Docker Services and Containers](#docker-services-and-containers).\n*  Docker containers have a type of ``docker_container`` and can have a `name` key with a string value or a `filters` key with a dictionary of filters. See [Docker Services and Containers](#docker-services-and-containers).\n* Systemd units  have a type of ``docker_service``, a `name` key with the unit name, and optionally an `action` key that can be either ``restart``or ``reload``. The default `action` is ``restart``. The `name` is the full unit names (with the unit type extension eg `nginx.service`). The value of `action` corresponds the systemctl arguments. See [Systemd Units](#systemd-units).\n* Arbitrary scripts have the `type` ``script`` and a `name` key with the path of the script to execute. See [Scripts](#scripts).\n\nThis is an example of a hyper simple cron job or Systemd timer run client config that just moves the certs and doesn't restart any services.\n```\ndestination: /etc/letsencrypt/live\n```\n\nIn a case like this the certs are delivered via whatever ssh server is running on the client host and the `certdeploy-client` script is run as a user with permission to write to the destination directory (probably root). See the [this](#client-security-considerations) section for more info and security considerations.\n\n#### Service settings\n\n##### Scripts\nThe only option for scripts is `name` which is the path to the script.\n`name` can be an absolute path, an executable in the system's ``$PATH``, or relative path (complicated). The path is evaluated in that order.\nThe relative path is relative to the current working directory which is different depending on how the client is being run.\n```yaml\nupdate_services:\n  - type: script\n    name: script_in_path.sh\n  - type: script\n    name: /path/to/script.sh\n```\n\n##### Systemd Units\nThe two config fields for each Systemd service are `name` and `action`. `action` can be `restart` or `reload` which correspond to the ``systemctl restart ...`` and ``systemctl reload ...`` commands. The default `action` is `restart`.\n```yaml\nupdate_services:\n  - type: systemd\n    name: nginx_or_whatever.service\n  - type: systemd\n    name: apache_or_whatever.service\n    action: reload\n```\n\n##### Docker Services and Containers\nThe two config fields for each docker service or container are `name` and `filters`. Either name or filters can be given.\n```yaml\nupdate_services:\n  - type: docker_service\n    name: ingress_nginx\n  - type: docker_service\n    label:\n      - restart_on_cert_update\n  - type: docker_container\n    name: web_nginx_1\n  - type: docker_container\n    filters:\n      name: web_traefik_1\n```\n\nThe first of the example definitions is equivalent to the following:\n```yaml\nupdate_services:\n  - type: docker_service\n    filters:\n      name: \"^ingress_nginx$\"\n```\nThe name is automatically converted into a filter for the exact match if no filters are given.\n\n\n#### Daemon specific settings\nThe `sftpd` section contains the settings for the SFTP server that accepts incoming certs from the CertDeploy server.\n* `listen_port` (optional) - The port the CertDeploy client (SFTP server) listens on. Defaults to 22.\n* listen_address` (optional) - The address the CertDeploy client (SFTP server) listens on. Defaults to listening on all interfaces.\n* `username` (optional) - The username to require the CertDeploy server to login with. Defaults to `certdeploy`.\n* `privkey_filename` - The path to the CertDeploy client (SFTP server) private key file. This is optional if `privkey` is given.\n* `server_pubkey` - The text of the remote CertDeploy server (SFTP client) public key. This is optional if `server_pubkey_filename` is given and is overridden by `server_pubkey_filename`.\n* `server_pubkey_filename` - The path to the remote CertDeploy server (SFTP client) public key file. This is optional if `server_pubkey` is given.\n* `log_level` (optional) - The SFTP server log level. Defaults to `ERROR`. The valid values for this correspond to `logging` log levels.\n* `log_filename` (optional) - The log file for the SFTP server. Defaults to ``/dev/stderr``.\n\nExample snippet:\n```yaml\nsftpd:\n  listen_port: 33774\n  privkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/client_key\n  server_pubkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/server_key.pub\n```\n\n#### Full Client Config Example\nThis config accepts new certs via SFTP into the default source directory. Moves them to the given destination directory. Then updates services. It restarts the nginx systemd service. It runs two scripts. It restarts a docker container. It force-updates docker swarm services based on two sets of filters. The updates aren't garanteed to be in any given order for now. The plan is to make the order something users set.\n```yaml\n---\ndestination: /etc/letsencrypt/live\nupdate_services:\n  - type: systemd\n    name: nginx.service\n  - type: script\n    name: touch-flag-file.sh\n  - type: script\n    name: poke-the-custom-server.sh\n  - type: docker_container\n    name: internal_traefik_1\n  - type: docker_service\n    filters:\n      label:\n        - restart_on_cert_update\nsftpd:\n  listen_port: 33774\n  privkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/client_key\n  server_pubkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/server_key.pub\n```\n\n#### Client Security Considerations\nWhen run as a script or daemon outside of docker it's expected that the CertDeploy client will run as root or a user that has permission to manage system services and docker. Because it can run arbitrary code (via the `script` service definitions) it is very strongly recommended that the config file and the update scripts are globally read only or readable only by the user that runs the client, and writable only by root or at most only the user that runs the client.\n\n#### Installation\n\n##### Cron Job\n1. Create a config directory ``mkdir /etc/certdeploy``.\n1. Create a config in ``/etc/certdeploy/client.yml``.\n    ```yaml\n    ---\n    source: /var/cache/certdeploy\n    destination: /etc/letsencrypt/live\n    update_services:\n      <put your service definitions here>\n    ```\n1. Ensure your `source` directory exists, is owned by the user the client is running as, and that only that user can read the contents of that directory.\n1. Ensure the `destination` directory exists and is writable by the user the client is running as.\n1. Add a cron entry that runs the ``certdeploy-client`` at whatever frequency you want.\n    ```\n    @daily                   /usr/bin/certdeploy-client\n    ```\n\n##### Daemon\n1. Create a config directory ``mkdir /etc/certdeploy``.\n1. Generate a client key pair ``ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/certdeploy/client_key``. Don't enter a password. CertDeploy doesn't support password files.\n1. Create a config in ``/etc/certdeploy/client.yml``.\n    ```yaml\n    ---\n    source: /var/cache/certdeploy\n    destination: /etc/letsencrypt/live\n    update_services:\n      <put your service definitions here>\n    sftpd:\n      listen_port: 33774\n      privkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/client_key\n      server_pubkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/server_key.pub\n    ```\n1. Ensure your `source` directory exists, is owned by the user the client is running as, and that only that user can read the contents of that directory.\n1. Ensure the `destination` directory exists and is writable by the user the client is running as.\n1. Start the daemon.\n    ```sh\n    certdeploy-client --daemon\n    ```\n\n##### Systemd Daemon\nTo run the client as a daemon with systemd the following example unit can be used.\n\n/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/certdeploy-client.service\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Certdeploy Client Daemon\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=exec\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/certdeploy-client --daemon\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nThe instructions above for configuring the daemon apply here. Except for the \"Start the daemon\" step which should be replaced with the following commands.\n```sh\nsystemctl enable certdeploy-client.service\nsystemctl start certdeploy-client.service\n```\n\n##### Systemd Timer\nIf only syncronization between directories is needed these two systemd units can be used to run the client as a script every hour.\n\n/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/certdeploy-client.service\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Certdeploy Client\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/certdeploy-client\n```\n\n/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/certdeploy-client.timer\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=CertDeploy Client Timer\n\n[Timer]\nOnUnitActiveSec=1h\nUnit=certdeploy-client.service\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=timers.target\n```\n\nThe instructions in the \"Cron Job\" section above can be followed until the \"Add a cron entry ...\" step which should be replaced with the following.\n```sh\nsystemctl enable certdeploy-client.timer\n```\n\n##### Docker\n1. Create a config directory ``mkdir conf``.\n1. Generate a client key pair ``ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f conf/client_key``. Don't enter a password. CertDeploy doesn't support password files.\n1. Create a config in ``conf/client.yml``.\n    ```yaml\n    ---\n    source: /certdeploy/staging\n    destination: /certdeploy/certs\n    update_delay: 10m\n    update_services:\n      <put your service definitions here>\n    sftpd:\n      listen_port: 33774\n      privkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/client_key\n      server_pubkey_filename: /etc/certdeploy/server_key.pub\n    ```\n1. Start the daemon.\n    ```sh\n    docker run -d -v $(pwd)/conf:/etc/certdeploy -v shared_certs:/certdeploy/certs haxwithaxe/certdeploy-client\n    ```\n    Where ``shared_certs`` is a docker volume shared with other containers that need access to the certs.\n\n    Or with docker-compose using this:\n    ```yaml\n    ---\n    version: \"3\"\n\n    services:\n      certdeploy-client:\n        image: haxwithaxe/certdeploy-client\n        volumes:\n          - \"./conf:/etc/certdeploy\"\n          - \"shared_certs:/certdeploy/certs\"\n    ```\n\n<!-- pyscaffold-notes -->\n\n## Note\n\nThis project has been set up using PyScaffold 4.3.
