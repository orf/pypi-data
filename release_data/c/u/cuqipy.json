CUQIpy provides a simple high-level interface to perform UQ analysis of inverse problems, while still allowing full control of the models and methods. The package comes equipped with a number of predefined distributions, samplers, models and test problems and is built to be easily further extended when needed.\n\nYou can find the full CUQIpy documentation [here](https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/). \n\nThis software package is part of the [CUQI project](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/cuqi) funded by [the Villum Foundation.](https://veluxfoundations.dk/en/forskning/teknisk-og-naturvidenskabelig-forskning)\n\n## Quickstart\nInstall CUQIpy using pip:\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\npip install cuqipy\n```\nFor more detailed instructions, see the [Getting Started](https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/user/getting_started.html) guide.\n\n## Quick Example - UQ in 5 steps\nImage deconvolution with uncertainty quantification\n```python\n# Imports\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom cuqi.testproblem import Deconvolution2D\nfrom cuqi.data import grains\nfrom cuqi.distribution import Laplace_diff, Gaussian\nfrom cuqi.problem import BayesianProblem\n\n# Step 1: Model and data, y = Ax\nA, y_data, info = Deconvolution2D.get_components(dim=128, phantom=grains())\n\n# Step 2: Prior, x ~ Laplace_diff(0, 0.01)\nx = Laplace_diff(location=np.zeros(A.domain_dim),\n                 scale=0.01,\n                 bc_type='neumann',\n                 physical_dim=2)\n\n# Step 3: Likelihood, y ~ N(Ax, 0.0036^2)\ny = Gaussian(mean=A@x, cov=0.0036**2)\n\n# Step 4: Set up Bayesian problem and sample posterior\nBP = BayesianProblem(y, x).set_data(y=y_data)\nsamples = BP.sample_posterior(200)\n\n# Step 5: Analysis\ninfo.exactSolution.plot(); plt.title(\"Exact solution\")\ny_data.plot(); plt.title(\"Data\")\nsamples.plot_mean(); plt.title(\"Posterior mean\")\nsamples.plot_std(); plt.title(\"Posterior standard deviation\")\n```\n\n<p float=\"left\">\n<img src=\"https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/_images/deconv2D_exact_sol.png\" alt=\"Exact solution\" width=\"330\">\n<img src=\"https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/_images/deconv2D_data.png\" alt=\"Data\" width=\"330\">\n<img src=\"https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/_images/deconv2D_post_mean.png\" alt=\"Posterior mean\" width=\"330\">\n<img src=\"https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/_images/deconv2D_post_std.png\" alt=\"Posterior standard deviation\" width=\"330\">\n</p>\n\n## Plugins\nCUQIpy can be extended with additional functionality by installing optional plugins. These can be found at\n[CUQI-DTU](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU?q=CUQIpy-).\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions to CUQIpy.
