This requires a second `pip install` call. For example, if you'd like to use the `jupyter_server` plugin, you'll need to call:\n\n```bash\npip install \"pytest-jupyter[server]\"\n```\n\nThis *should* install everything you need for the plugin to work.\n\nTo use a plugin, add it to the `pytest_plugins` list in the `conftest.py` of your project's root test directory.\n\n```python\n# inside the conftest.py\n\npytest_plugins = [\"pytest_jupyter.jupyter_server\"]\n```\n\nAll fixtures inside the plugin (e.g. jupyter_server) will be available to all of your project's unit tests. You can use a fixtures by passing it as an argument to your unit test function:\n\n```python\nasync def test_jupyter_server_api(jp_fetch):\n    # Send request to a temporary Jupyter Server Web Application\n    response = await jp_fetch(\"api/spec.yml\")\n\n    # Confirm that the request is successful.\n    assert response.code == 200\n```\n\nYou can list the fixtures for a given plugin using the `--fixtures` argument from the pytest command line interface:\n\n```bash\npytest --fixtures -p pytest_jupyter.jupyter_server\n```\n\nor by calling the `pytest --fixtures` where the plugin is listed in the `pytest_plugins` variable of a given test directory.\n",

This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.",
