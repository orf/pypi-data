These components are packaged as \"bricks\", which provide\nusers the building blocks they need to build pipelines targeted at the documents they care\nabout. Bricks in the library fall into three categories:\n\n- :jigsaw: ***Partitioning bricks*** that break raw documents down into standard, structured\n  elements.\n- :broom: ***Cleaning bricks*** that remove unwanted text from documents, such as boilerplate and\n  sentence\n  fragments.\n- :performing_arts: ***Staging bricks*** that format data for downstream tasks, such as ML inference\n  and data labeling.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the library, run `pip install unstructured`.\n\n## Developer Quick Start\n\n* Using `pyenv` to manage virtualenv's is recommended\n\t* Mac install instructions. See [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#mac--homebrew) for more detailed instructions.\n\t\t* `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`\n\t  * `pyenv install 3.8.13`\n  * Linux instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#linux).\n\n* Create a virtualenv to work in and activate it, e.g. for one named `unstructured`:\n\n\t`pyenv  virtualenv 3.8.13 unstructured` <br />\n\t`pyenv activate unstructured`\n\n* Run `make install-project-local`\n\n## Quick Tour\n\nThe following examples show how to get started with the `unstructured` library. See\nour [documentation page](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured) for a full description\nof the features in the library.\n\n### HTML Parsing\n\nYou can parse an HTML document using the following workflow:\n\n```python\nfrom unstructured.documents.html import HTMLDocument\n\ndoc = HTMLDocument.from_file(\"example-docs/example-10k.html\")\nprint(doc.pages[2])\n```\n\nThe output of this will be the following:\n\n```\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis report contains statements that do not relate to historical or current facts but are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements. These statements relate to analyses and other information based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements may also relate to future events or trends, our future prospects and proposed new products, services, developments or business strategies, among other things. These statements can generally (although not always) be identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, appear, believe, could, would, estimate, expect, indicate, intent, may, plan, predict, project, pursue, will continue and other similar terms and phrases, as well as the use of the future tense.\n\nActual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and to inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should not assume at any point in the future that the forward-looking statements in this report are still valid. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update our forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.\n```\n\nIf you then run:\n\n```python\ndoc.pages[2].elements\n```\n\nYou'll get the following output, showing that the parser successfully differentiated between\ntitles and narrative text.\n\n```python\n[<unstructured.documents.base.Title at 0x169cbe820>,\n <unstructured.documents.base.NarrativeText at 0x169cbe8e0>,\n <unstructured.documents.base.NarrativeText at 0x169cbe3a0>]\n```\n\n### PDF Parsing\n\nYou can use the following workflow to parse PDF documents. Note, PDF parsing is currently\nexpiremental and will be refined in the coming months.\n\n```python\nfrom unstructured.documents.pdf import PDFDocument\n\ndoc = PDFDocument.from_file(\"example-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf\")\nprint(doc)\n```\n\nAt this point, `print(doc)` will print out a string representation of the PDF file. The\nfirst page of output looks like the following:\n\n```\n\nLayoutParser : A Uni\ufb01ed Toolkit for Deep Learning Based Document Image Analysis\n\nZejiang Shen 1 ( (cid:0) ), Ruochen Zhang 2 , Melissa Dell 3 , Benjamin Charles Germain Lee 4 , Jacob Carlson 3 , and\nWeining Li 5\n\nAbstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural\nnetworks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation.\nHowever, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model con\ufb01gurations complicate the easy\nreuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going e\ufb00orts to improve reusability and\nsimplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none\nof them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA\nis central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper\nintroduces LayoutParser , an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions.\nThe core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models\nfor layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility,\nLayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation\npipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in\nreal-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io\n\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis \u00b7 Deep Learning \u00b7 Layout Analysis \u00b7 Character Recognition \u00b7 Open Source library \u00b7\nToolkit.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of document image analysis (DIA) tasks\nincluding document image classi\ufb01cation [11,\n```\n\nThe `Document` has a `pages` attribute consisting of `Page` object and the `Page` object\nhas an `element` attribute consisting of `Element` objects. Sub-types of the `Element` class\nrepresent different components of a document, such as `NarrativeText` and `Title`. You can use\nthese normalized elements to zero in on the components of a document you most care about.\n\n## Security Policy\n\nSee our [security policy](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/security/policy) for\ninformation on how to report security vulnerabilities.\n\n## Learn more\n\n| Section | Description |\n|-|-|\n| [Company Website](https://unstructured.io) | Unstructured.io product and company info |\n| [Documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured) | Full API documentation |",
