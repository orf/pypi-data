We first identify the proportion of the full training data that will serve as the validation data. Then, we define the validation steps. For each step that is a multiple of the validation step, we generate synthetic data from the model. Then, we use the generated sample together with the validation data to train the discriminator model and quantify the model's ability to generate realistic samples.\n\nWe should note that at the early stages of the model, the model will not be able to generate meaningful observations. This implies that we should at least set a warm-up period before we perform the disciminator-based assessment.\n",
