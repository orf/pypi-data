            "description": ".. image:: docs/source/_static/Logo_cmrsim.svg\n   :align: right\n   :scale: 150 %\n\nWelcome to CMRsim!\n==================================\n\nCMRsim is a MRI - simulation framework that features bloch-simulations as well as analytic signal\nevaluations for **moving objects** with an easy to use API written in pure python.\nThe computationally demanding calculations are implemented in `TensorFlow2`_ and therefore are\nseamlessly executable on CPU and GPU environments, while also making efficient use of computational\nresources!\n\n.. _TensorFlow2: https://www.tensorflow.org/\n\nWhat makes CMRsim special?\n\n- CMRsim features bloch-simulations as well as simulations using analytical signal equations and even allows to combine elements of both.\n- Convenient support for **moving** particles!\n- Modularity that makes to designing comparative simulation experiments convenient.\n- Architecture and implementation that allows to easily include your own simulation modules.\n- Reproducibility by using versioned and documented open-source software.\n- Easily scalable to detailed digital phantoms\n\nInstallation\n==============\n\n\nPip\n^^^^\nCMRsim can be installed using the python package manager :code:`pip`. The package can be found\nin the `registry`_  of the repository hosted on the ETH-Gitlab instance\n\n.. _registry: https://gitlab.ethz.ch/jweine/cmrsim/-/packages\n\n**Versioning:**\nStable release versions are denoted with the ususal :code:`major.minor` notation. Additionally,\ndevelopment versions are constantly updated on solved issued and can be installed using the\n:code:`major.minor.devX` notation\n\nInstallation in command line:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    pip install cmrsim --extra-index-url https://__token__:<your_personal_token>@gitlab.ethz.ch/api/v4/projects/23798/packages/pypi/simple\n\n\nRequirements\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nCMRsim does rely on functionality of 3 non-standard python stack packages:\n\n1. `TensorFlow`_: Pretty much all computationally heavy calculations.\n2. `Pyvista`_: For processing and visualizing graphs (e.g. 3D Velocity fields).\n3. `CMRseq`_: For defining MR-sequences used for Fourier-Encoding calculation and Bloch-simulation.\n\n.. _TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/\n.. _Pyvista: https://docs.pyvista.org/\n.. _CMRseq: https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~jweine/cmrseq/index.html\n\nFurther (already indirectly included) requirements are:\n-h5py~=2.10.0\n-scipy>=1.4.1\n-tqdm\n\n\nDocker\n^^^^^^^^\nFor each major release a set of docker images are compiled and published in the\n`container registry`_ associated with repository. Within the docker images, all requirements\nare installed for simulation deployment.\n\n.. _container registry: https://gitlab.ethz.ch/jweine/cmrsim/container_registry\n\nFurthermore, there are three image-tags available. To use the pull the docker image\nuse (e.g. for jupyter tag):\n\n.. code-block::\n\n    docker pull registry.ethz.ch/jweine/cmrsim/jupyter:latest\n\nCPU\n\"\"\"\"\nBased on the Tensorflow:...-cpu:latest docker image. Containing all cmrsim dependencies and cmrsim\n\nGPU\n\"\"\"\"\nBased on the Tensorflow:...-gpu:latest docker image. Containing all cmrsim dependencies and cmrsim\n\nJupyter\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\nBased on the gpu:latest tag, but also includes an installation of jupyter-lab for interactive\nsimulation / rendering.\n\n\n",
