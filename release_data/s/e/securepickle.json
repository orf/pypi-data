If you store pickled data in a database or filesystem that could be compromised or accessed by someone with malicious intentions, you should use `securepickle`. \n\nIf you're not sure if you need it, it might be better to be safe than sorry.`securepickle` is a drop-in replacement for `pickle`, so you don't need to change any of your loading code.\n\n## Why should I use `securepickle` instead of another secure pickling solution?\n`securepickle` has 0 dependencies. It only uses the python standard library, and supports python 2 and 3.\n`securepickle` has a documented file format and promises to be backward compatible. You will be able to unpickle your data even if the `securepickle` library or the used cryptographic primitives change.\n\n## How do I use it?\n```\nimport securepickle as pickle\n# DON'T USE THIS KEY! Make sure to generate your own key randomly\nsecurepickle.set_key(\"BO4cHKNaJE0GmiShTQ8mL8oSvqBDCx2q5Xdq7iNeCaU\")\n\n...\n\npickle.loads(...)\npickle.load(...)\npickle.dump(...)\npickle.dumps(...)\n```\n\n## Where should I store my key\nMake sure you don't store the key in the same location of the pickled data. It's also recommended to not store the key on the source code.\n\n## What kind of attacks does `securepickle` prevent\n\n`securepickle` prevents [arbitrary code execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution) from attackers that can modify (or directly influence) the pickled data.\nThis can happen, for example, if your database is compromised, or you store pickled files in a filesystem without regard to file access permissions.\n\n`securepickle` does **NOT** prevent random people from unpickling the pickled data, even without the key. If this is a scenario you're concerned about, you should use standard database or disk encryption mechanisms. \n\n## What's the file format\n```securepickle|<version>|<crypto primitive>|<signature>|<pickled data>```\nList of crypto primitive strings supported:\n\n  - `HMAC(SHA512)`\n\n\n\n",
