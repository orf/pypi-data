Generally, the system is controlled through signals that originate at a control point (or control points) and\nmove through the network. In the brain, NCT models each region\u2019s activity as a time-dependent internal state that is\npredicted from a combination of three factors: (i) its previous state, (ii) whole-brain structural connectivity,\nand (iii) external inputs. NCT enables asking a broad range of questions of a networked system that are highly relevant\nto network neuroscientists, such as: which regions are positioned such that they can efficiently distribute activity\nthroughout the brain to drive changes in brain states? Do different brain regions control system dynamics in different\nways? Given a set of control nodes, how can the system be driven to specific target state, or switch between a pair of\nstates, by means of internal or external control input?\n\n``nctpy`` is a Python toolbox that provides researchers with a set of tools to conduct some of the\ncommon NCT analyses reported in the literature. Below, we list select publications that serve as a primer for\nthese tools and their use cases:\n\n1. Gu, S., Pasqualetti, F., Cieslak, M. et al.
