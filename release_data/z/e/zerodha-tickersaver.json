Just add the  Zerodha instrument_id , tradingsymbol in the ```conf/ticker_instruments.csv``` file  For example: ```12628226,BANKNIFTY22N0339500PE```\n- When new positions are taken in Zerodha account and if they need to be subscribed to dynamically then just create a file ```touch instrument_touch.txt``` which will load all current positions from Zerodha account and subscribe to them and start saving the current price .\n\n# Usage\n- User needs to manually login into Kite on any browser , and copy the below token \n <img height=\"100\" alt=\"Ticker Saver\" src=\"https://github.com/simonmh2u/TickerSaver/docs/logo.png\" />\n- Needs to set the username and token as environment variables \"ZUSERNAME\"  and \"ZWSSTOKEN\" respectively\n- Needs to add in conf/config.json the \"zusername\" and \"zwsstoken\" (this overrides the above env variables)\n\t```\n\t{\n\t\t\"username\":\"YL1111\",\n\t\t\"wsstoken\":\"XXXXXXX\"\n\t}\n\t```\n# Disclaimer\nTickerSaver is an application built for self learning and as a  Jugaad *(definition: a resourceful approach to problem-solving)* to understand the working of web-sockets and to see if the live tick data from zerodha can be extracted and saved locally tick by tick for free without paying for monthly charges for API access. Please use at your own discretion.\n\n",
