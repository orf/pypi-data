Searches can be performed using a number of available analysis methods employed in isolation or together.\n\n\nCurrently available analysis methods (scoring methods):\n- **Metcalf** (standardised): see [Hj\u00f6rleifsson Eldj\u00e1rn G, et al. (2021)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008920), [Doroghazi JR, et al. (2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.1659), and the [demo](notebooks/nplinker_demo1.ipynb).\n- **Rosetta**: see [Hj\u00f6rleifsson Eldj\u00e1rn G, et al. (2021)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008920) and [Soldatou S, et al. (2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/103).\n- **NPClassScore**: see the preprint [Louwen JJR, et al. (2022)](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1391827/v2), and the [demo](notebooks/npclassscore_linking/NPClassScore_demo.ipynb).\n\n## Setup and usage\n\nNPLinker is a Python package, you can install it as following:\n```\n# create a new virtual environment\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\n\n# install nplinker package\npip install nplinker\n\n# install nplinker non-pypi dependencies and databases\ninstall-nplinker-deps\n```\n\nDue to hardware requirements of some non-pypi dependecies:\n- NPLinker can only be installed on `Linux` and `MacOS (Intel chip)`\n- `MacOS(Apple Silicon, M1/M2 chip)` user should execute the install commands in a [Rosseta-enabled terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861).\n- For `Windows` users, please use our [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nlesc/nplinker).\n\n\nSee the example in [Jupyter notebook](notebooks/nplinker_demo1.ipynb) for a guided introduction to the NPLinker API which shows how to load and examine a dataset. Other notebooks are present showcasing other scoring methods, like for [NPClassScore](notebooks/npclassscore_linking/NPClassScore_demo.ipynb).\n\nIf you want to visualize and manipulate NPLinker predictions, check [NPLinker Webapp](https://github.com/NPLinker/nplinker-webapp) for more info.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute to the development of nplinker, have a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [README for developers](README.dev.md).\n",
