Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

            "description": "skew\n====\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scopely-devops/skew.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/scopely-devops/skew)\n\n**Skew** is a package for identifying and enumerating cloud resources.\nThe name is a homonym for SKU (Stock Keeping Unit).  Skew allows you to\ndefine different SKU ``schemes`` which are a particular encoding of a\nSKU.  Skew then allows you to use this scheme pattern and regular expressions\nbased on the scheme pattern to identify and enumerate a resource or set\nof resources.\n\nAt the moment, the the only available ``scheme`` is the ``ARN`` scheme.\nThe ``ARN`` scheme uses the basic structure of\n[Amazon Resource Names](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) (ARNs) to assign a unique identifier to every AWS\nresource.\n\nAn example ARN pattern would be:\n\n    arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678\n\nThis pattern identifies a specific EC2 instance running in the ``us-west-2``\nregion under the account ID ``123456789012``.  The account ID is the 12-digit\nunique identifier for a specific AWS account as described\n[here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html).\nTo allow **skew** to find your account number, you need to add it to your\nbotocore/AWSCLI config file.  For example:\n\n    [profile prod]\n    aws_access_key_id = <my access key>\n    aws_secret_access_key = <my secret key>\n    region = us-west-2\n    account_id = 123456789012\n\nSkew will look through all of the profiles defined in your config file and\nkeep track of all of the ones that have an ``account_id`` associated with\nthem.\n\nThe main point of skew is to identify AWS resources or sets of resources and\nto quickly and easily return the data associated with those resources.\nFor example, if you wanted to return the data associated with the example\nARN above:\n\n    from skew import scan\n\n\tarn = scan('arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-12345678')\n\tfor resource in arn:\n\t    print(resource.data)\n\nThe call to ``scan`` returns an ARN object which implements the\n[iterator pattern](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types)\nand returns a ``Resource`` object for each AWS resource that matches the\nARN pattern provided.  The ``Resource`` object contains all of the data\nassociated with the AWS resource in dictionary under the ``data`` attribute.\n\nAny of the elements of the ARN can be replaced with a regular expression.\nThe simplest regular expression is ``*`` which means all available choices.\nSo, for example:\n\n    arn = scan('arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:*:instance/*')\n\nwould return an iterator for all EC2 instances in the ``us-east-1`` region\nfound in all accounts defined in the config file.\n\nTo find all DynamoDB tables in all US regions for the account ID 234567890123\nyou would use:\n\n    arn = scan('arn:aws:dynamodb:us-.*:234567890123:table/*')\n\nCloudWatch Metrics\n------------------\n\nIn addition to making the metadata about a particular AWS resource available\nto you, ``skew`` also tries to make it easy to access the available CloudWatch\nmetrics for a given resource.\n\nFor example, assume that you had did a ``scan`` on the original ARN above\nand had the resource associated with that instance available as the variable\n``instance``.  You could do the following:\n\n    >>> instance.metric_names\n\t['CPUUtilization',\n     'NetworkOut',\n     'StatusCheckFailed',\n     'StatusCheckFailed_System',\n     'NetworkIn',\n     'DiskWriteOps',\n     'DiskReadBytes',\n     'DiskReadOps',\n     'StatusCheckFailed_Instance',\n     'DiskWriteBytes']\n\t >>>\n\nThe ``metric_names`` attribute returns the list of available CloudWatch metrics\nfor this resource.  The retrieve the metric data for one of these:\n\n    >>> instance.get_metric_data('CPUUtilization')\n\t[{u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:04:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.066, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:54:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.066, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:09:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:34:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.066, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:19:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.068, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:44:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:14:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.066, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:29:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.132, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:59:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:49:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.134, u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T13:39:00Z', u'Unit': 'Percent'}]\n    >>>\n\nYou can also customize the data returned rather than using the default settings:\n\n    >>> instance.get_metric_data('CPUUtilization', hours=8, statistics=['Average', 'Minimum', 'Maximum'])\n\t[{u'Average': 0.132,\n      u'Maximum': 0.33,\n      u'Minimum': 0.0,\n      u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T10:54:00Z',\n      u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.134,\n      u'Maximum': 0.34,\n      u'Minimum': 0.0,\n      u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T14:04:00Z',\n      u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n\t  ...,\n     {u'Average': 0.066,\n      u'Maximum': 0.33,\n      u'Minimum': 0.0,\n      u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T08:34:00Z',\n      u'Unit': 'Percent'},\n     {u'Average': 0.134,\n      u'Maximum': 0.34,\n      u'Minimum': 0.0,\n      u'Timestamp': '2014-09-29T08:04:00Z',\n      u'Unit': 'Percent'}]\n    >>>",
