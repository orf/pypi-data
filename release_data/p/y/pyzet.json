It happens mainly\n> within the Zettelkasten\".\n\n`pyzet` is a CLI tool targeted at note-taking and personal knowledge\nmanagement using the Zettelkasten approach with Git repos.\n\n## Installation\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n* Python 3.7+\n* Git 2.25+ (but older also should be fine)\n\nLinux, macOS, and Windows are supported.\n\nYou can install pyzet with pip:\n\n    pip install pyzet\n    pyzet --help\n\nAlternatively, directly from GitHub you can install the newest version\nthat may contain some yet unreleased changes (you can inspect\n[changelog](https://github.com/wojdatto/pyzet/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\nfor more details):\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/wojdatto/pyzet.git\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f\\\n> `pyzet` is a work in progress, so you may encounter difficulties and\n> annoyances while using it. If you have any problem, question, or\n> suggestion, feel free to create an issue on GitHub. We have many ideas\n> how to expand pyzet, so make sure to go through [opened\n> issues](https://github.com/wojdatto/pyzet/issues) first. **Any\n> feedback is welcome!**\n\n## Quick start\n\nCreate the simplest required config file, and initialize your\nZettelkasten repository.\n\nLinux/macOS:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/pyzet\necho 'repo: ~/zet' > ~/.config/pyzet/pyzet.yaml\npyzet init\n```\n\nWindows (with `PowerShell`):\n\n```powershell\nmkdir -p ~/.config/pyzet\necho 'repo: ~/zet' | Set-Content ~/.config/pyzet/pyzet.yaml\npyzet init\n```\n\n`pyzet --help` will tell you more about available commands.\n\n`pyzet sample-config` show you how you can extend your config file. You\nshould especially do this when:\n\n1. Your Git executable isn't in the usual default location.\n2. You don't want Vim as the text editor used by pyzet.\n\n## Tutorial\n\nPlease see the full tutorial\n[here](https://github.com/wojdatto/pyzet/tree/main/docs).\n\n## Summary of commands\n\n```none\n$ pyzet -h\nusage: pyzet [-h] [-r REPO] [-c CONFIG] [-V] [-v]\n             {init,add,edit,rm,show,list,tags,clean,grep,status,pull,push,remote,sample-config} ...\n\npositional arguments:\n  {init,add,edit,rm,show,list,tags,clean,grep,status,pull,push,remote,sample-config}\n    init                initialize a git ZK repo at configured or given path\n    add                 add a new zettel\n    edit                edit an existing zettel\n    rm                  remove a zettel\n    show                print zettel contents\n    list                list all zettels\n    tags                list all tags and count them\n    clean               delete empty folders in 'zettels' folder in ZK repo\n    grep                run 'git grep' with some handy flags in ZK repo\n    status              run 'git status' in ZK repo\n    pull                run 'git pull --rebase' in ZK repo\n    push                run 'git push' in ZK repo\n    remote              run 'git remote' in ZK repo\n    sample-config       produce a sample pyzet.yaml file\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -r REPO, --repo REPO  point to a custom ZK repo\n  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG\n                        use an alternative config file\n  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit\n  -v, --verbose         increase verbosity of the output\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe basic configuration of pyzet is set via YAML file which should be\nplaced at `~/.config/pyzet/pyzet.yaml`. However, there is a `--config`\nflag that can be used to point to a custom config file using relative or\nglobal path.\n\nConfig file contains a set of possible fields of which only `repo` is\nrequired to be set. The remaining ones will use default values if they\nare not set in the config file.\n\n### Default config values\n\nOn Linux (or actually: \"not Windows\", so it will trigger also on Mac)\nthey will be compatible with Ubuntu and possibly some other distros:\n\n    editor: /usr/bin/vim\n    git: /usr/bin/git\n\nOn Windows the executables installed with Git for Windows are used as\ndefault options:\n\n    editor: C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/vim.exe\n    git: C:/Program Files/Git/cmd/git.exe\n\nForward slashes `/` can be used even on Windows. Backslashes `\\` or\ndouble backslashes `\\\\` should also work, but it wasn't thoroughly\ntested.\n\nAlso, remember that paths cannot include env variables, but you can use\n`~` to point to your `$HOME` directory.\n\nFor the sake of this readme, we assume that your repo setting will be\nunder `~/zet`.\n\nYou can have multiple repos, and only a single config file, because\nthere is `--repo` flag that you can always set to point to a custom repo\n(and possibly, create an alias that includes it). If this flag is used,\nthe setting from YAML is ignored.\n\nAn example correct config file:\n\n    repo: ~/zet\n    editor: /usr/bin/vim\n    git: /usr/bin/git\n\nIf you're on Linux (or Git Bash on Windows), you can use the commands:\n\n    mkdir -p ~/.config/pyzet\n    pyzet sample-config > ~/.config/pyzet/pyzet.yaml\n\nto create required folders and a copy of the above correct config file\ninto the default location.\n\n## Supported editors\n\nPyzet is a CLI application which cooperates with a text editor of\nchoice. The best integration can be probably achieved when also using a\nCLI text editor.\n\nBut this is not necessary. Currently, pyzet can cooperate with different\ntext editors, even these that have a GUI but the integration is not\nideal.\n\nBelow are listed editors that pyzet was tested with. To use a given\neditor, add an `editor` field to your config file.\n\n### Linux\n\nThe actual testing was done on Ubuntu WSL2 with these CLI editors, and\nthey work fine:\n\n    editor: vim\n    editor: nano\n\n### Windows\n\nOn Windows, the following editors seem to work fine:\n\n    editor: vim  # only if running pyzet from Git Bash\n    editor: nano # only if running pyzet from Git Bash\n    editor: C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/vim.exe\n    editor: C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/nano.exe\n    editor: C:/Program Files/Windows NT/Accessories/wordpad.exe\n    editor: notepad.exe\n\nSome issues were found with:\n\nNotepad++ -- closing a tab is not enough, you have to close the whole\nprogram to save a zettel.\n\n    editor: C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe\n\nVS Code -- issues with adding a zettel. If zettel file already exists,\nthen it seems to work similarly to Notepad++ (you have to close the\nwhole program to save a zettel):\n\n    editor: C:/Program Files/Microsoft VS Code/Code.exe\n\n### macOS\n\nNot yet tested. CLI editors compatible with Linux should work fine.\n\n## Manual installation\n\nManual installation is also possible. Clone the repo and run the install\ncommand. Using virtual environment is advised.\n\n    git clone https://github.com/wojdatto/pyzet.git\n    cd pyzet\n\nLinux:\n\n    python3 -m venv venv\n    . venv/bin/activate\n    pip install .\n    pyzet --help\n\nWindows:\n\n    python -m venv venv\n    .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n    pip install .\n    pyzet --help\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development installation\n\nDevelopment dependencies are stored in `requirements-dev.txt`. To\ninstall the package in editable mode with the dev dependencies run the\nfollowing after cloning the repo:\n\n    pip install -e .\n    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n\nFor running tests more easily, you might also want to install `tox`:\n\n    pip install tox\n\n### Running automatic tests\n\nPyzet uses pytest and tox to run automatic tests. Use `pytest` command\nto test against the current Python version, or use `tox` to test against\nall supported Python versions (you, of course, have to install them\nfirst). Tox will also allow you to easily measure test coverage along\nwith generating a coverage report. [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)\nis also configured as one of tox's envs, but it can be run independently\ndepending on your preference.\n\nAutomatic test coverage is good, but still not ideal at this point, and\nsome commands are only tested manually. This is especially true in case\nof commands that require a user input.\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\nContinuous integration with GitHub Actions is configured for the `main`\nbranch, `test-me-<any-name>` branches, and for each branch with an\nactive pull request.\n\nThere are two checks:\n\n* `tox` running tests against each supported Python version\n\n* `pre-commit` running with hooks defined in the [config\n  file](https://github.com/wojdatto/pyzet/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml)\n\n## Performance\n\nFrom real world testing, performance of `pyzet` doesn't seem to be a big\nissue at this moment.\n\nE.g. `pyzet list` (probably the slowest command) takes ~150 ms in repo\nwith 500 zettels.\n\nGenerally, we focus on using other performant utilities like `git grep`\nto do the hard work, and Python is performing a role of a handy\ninterface.\n\n### Windows users\n\nA significant performance boost can be achieved after moving to\n[WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). You have\nto run `pyzet` using Python interpreter from Linux, and your zet repo\nneeds to be placed on the Linux partition.\n\n## Zettel formatting rules and guidelines\n\nZettels should use Markdown. It is preferred to use consistent flavor of\nMarkdown like [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/). Pyzet will parse\nzettel's content trying to extract information like title and tags.\n\nIn fact, many rules described below are derived from Rob Muhlestein's\nZettelMark specification that can be found\n[here](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/blob/main/20210812154738/README.md),\nwhich is also based on CommonMark.\n\nSome of the rules described below are only guidelines, but some of them\nare needed for pyzet to correctly parse zettels.\n\n### General formatting\n\nFor a convenient reading of zettels in the source form, it's recommended\nto wrap lines. The [common standard](https://youtu.be/_U5heW26fvg) is to\nbreak line after 72 characters.\n\nIdeal zettels shouldn't be too long, and they should be a brief text\ndescription of pretty much anything. Avoid pasting links in the zettel\ncore content and prefer using references section (described below) for\nthat.\n\nPyzet supports tagging zettels with hashtags for easier searching in the\nfuture. For correct parsing, tags should all fit on a single line, so\ntheir number is naturally limited. Ideally they should only use keywords\nthat are not a part of a zettel itself, so they can help obtaining\nnon-obvious connections. The tagging rules are described below.\n\nTry to use consistent Markdown formatting. We recommend:\n\n* Use only `*` for bold & italics\n\n* Use only `*` for unordered lists\n\n* If any item of an unordered lists take more than a single line,\n  separate all of them with a single blank line\n\n* Use `<>` to show that something is an URL. GitHub and VSCode will\n  detect it even without it thanks to\n  [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/#autolinks-extension-), but this\n  is not true for every tool that supports Markdown (i.e. CommonMark\n  doesn't support it).\n\n### Title line\n\nThe first line of a zettel that should start with `#` and a single\nspace, and then the title itself. Title line shouldn't have any leading\nor trailing spaces.\n\nIf wrong formatting is detected, a warning will be raised and pyzet will\nshow you a raw title line instead of a parsed one.\n\nIdeally, title should not exceed 50 characters. This is because a title\nis also a commit message in a Zettelkasten repo, and GitHub will snip\nmessages longer than 50 characters when displaying commit messages next\nto the files. At this point, this is not checked by pyzet, so no warning\nwill be raised in that case.\n\n```markdown\n# Example correct zettel title\n```\n\n### References\n\nPyzet currently doesn't analyze references, but the suggested way to add\nthem is as follows:\n\n```markdown\nRefs:\n\n* <http://example.com/>\n\n* This is an example description\\\n  <http://described-example.com/>\n```\n\nZettelMark doesn't specify a keyword for a reference block, but we like\n`Refs` as it plays nice with `Tags` that will be described next.\nHowever, at this point, it's all up to the user preference.\n\nIf there is no URL description, an URL should be simply placed with a\nsingle space between it and `*`.\n\nIf an URL have a description, it should go first. A Markdown syntax for\na hard line break (`\\`) is used at the end of the description for a\nbetter rendering in the HTML. Then, a link should start from a new line\npreceded with two spaces, so it's aligned with the description.\n\nAlong with `\\`, Markdown supports different syntax for hard breaks:\n\n* two or more spaces\n* inserting HTML `<br>` tag\n\nWe believe that `\\` is superior to both of them, as a significant\ntrailing whitespace doesn't seem to be a right idea due to many reasons\n(e.g. it's very well hidden from you while editing). Also, a good\npractice is to avoid using plain HTML in Markdown files which eliminates\napproach with `<br>`.\n\n#### References shouldn't be wrapped\n\nEven if a reference line is longer than 72 characters, ZettelMark tells\nnot to wrap lines in this section, probably for easier parsing. This\ndoesn't matter as long as `Refs` are not parsed by pyzet, but it seems\nlike a reasonable rule to follow, so we recommend it:\n\n```markdown\nRefs:\n\n* <http://example.com/>\n\n* This is an example of a a very long description for some very interesting link\\\n  <http://described-example.com/>\n\n* This is an example of a slightly shorter description\\\n  <http://this-is-a-very-long-example-link-that-also-should-not-be-wrapped.com/>\n```\n\n### Tags\n\nTags are optional, but if they're used, they should be placed as the\nlast line of a zettel that starts from 4 or more leading spaces (it's\nMarkdown syntax for a fenced code block that renders as monospaced\nfont). Each tag should start with `#` and should be separated with a\nsingle space from the next one.\n\nUsing small letters and `kebab-case` is recommended as a consistent\ntagging style, but it's not forced or checked at this moment. A tag line\ncan be preceded by `Tags:` and a single blank line to make zettels more\nstructured.\n\n```markdown\nTags:\n\n    #tag1 #tag2 #another-tag\n```\n\nRemember that tags line should end with a newline character, so the\ncaret is moved to the next line which should be empty. This is by\ndefault assumed by some text editors like Vim, but is probably less\npopular in Windows world.\n\nThere are different ways to guarantee that file ending is correct, and\none of them is using pre-commit with `end-of-file-fixer` hook that\n[comes by default](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks.git)\nwith this tool. It's very easy to setup pre-commit with ZK Git\nrepository, so we recommend it.\n\n## Inspiration and further reading\n\nThe biggest inspiration for this project was Rob Muhlestein\n([`@rwxrob`](https://github.com/rwxrob)), and his approach to\nZettelkasten. Probably the best way to get a grasp of it, is to read\nabout it in [his public Zettelkasten\nrepo](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/blob/main/README.md). Rob also\nmaintains a Bash CLI tool\n[`cmd-zet`](https://github.com/rwxrob/cmd-zet.git).\n\nSee also:\n\n* Two essays by the creator of Zettelkasten, Niklas Luhmann\\\n  <https://luhmann.surge.sh/>\n\n* Even simpler approach to Zettelkasten\\\n  <https://gsilvapt.me/posts/building-a-zettelkasten-the-simple-way/>\n\n* Similar tool written in Go by the author of the above\\\n  <https://github.com/gsilvapt/pmz>\n\n* A Zettelkasten tool for people who prefer to have a GUI\\\n  <https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr>\n\n  There is also an [interesting video](https://youtu.be/c5Tst3-zcWI)\n  from the author of this tool that describes his vision of\n  Zettelkasten.\n\n## License\n\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, all files in this repository are\nlicensed under the Apache Software License 2.0:\n\n> Copyright 2021 Tomasz Wojdat\n>\n> Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you\n> may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
