            "description": "===============================================================================\nProgram allowing to run other programs only after some \"homework\" has been done\n===============================================================================\nA way to consolidate calculus and grammar skills\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral idea\n------------\n\nflo-check-homework presents one or more questionnaires to the user. Once all\nquestions have been answered, and if the score exceeds a predefined threshold,\na special button is enabled. When pressed, this button launches the program\n(with optional arguments) that was specified on flo-check-homework's command\nline.\n\nA \"magic formula\" button allows one to bypass the test in case the pupil has\nalready done his homework in another way. It also makes it possible to exit\nthe program immediately.\n\nIndeed, flo-check-homework refuses to quit immediately unless option -e was\ngiven or a sufficient score was obtained; this is done so as to avoid the\nchildren validating the whole questionnaire with incorrect answers only to get\ncorrections that they can blindly copy after rerunning the program. For the\nsame reason, some of the question generators purposedly don't remember\nincorrect answers, in contrast with the initial design.\n\nCurrently, the questions are designed to help consolidate simple additions,\nsubstractions, multiplications, euclidian divisions and conjugations of French\nverbs. The questionnaires are built at run-time and can be customized to some\nextent via a configuration file\n(~/.config/Florent Rougon/flo-check-homework.ini on Unix-like systems). It is\neasy for a Python programmer to add new question generators, questionnaires or\nsubquestionnaires.\n\nThe ItemGenerator class, which is the basis for many question generators, has\nthe following properties:\n\n  - starts with items that have been incorrectly answered in previous sessions\n  - cycles through all items but does not yield an item that has already been\n    seen in the current session (unless all items have been seen)\n  - Seen objects (used to remember which items of a given type have been seen\n    in the current session) can be shared between several question generators.\n    This avoids asking the same question twice in case several question\n    generators are likely to generate the same question.\n\nIt is possible to setup launcher scripts that call flo-check-homework with the\nappropriate parameters depending on the script (and parameters passed to the\nscript). The flo-check-homework-decorate-games program from the 'tools'\ndirectory is provided to help automate such a setup. Basically, you write a\nlist of programs/games in an XML file which we'll call DATAFILE for the sake\nof the example. You may look at flo-check-homework-decorate-games.xml from the\ntools/flo-check-homework-decorate-games folder or run\n'flo-check-homework-decorate-games --help' for an example of such a file. Once\nyou have a proper DATAFILE, run the following command as a user who has\npermission to write to /usr/local/games::\n\n  # flo-check-homework-decorate-games /path/to/DATAFILE\n\nThis will create an appropriate launcher script in /usr/local/games for every\nprogram listed in DATAFILE. If /usr/local/games is prepended to the system\nPATH, then the launcher scripts will take precedence over the corresponding\ngame executables when a user tries to run a game, unless a full path to the\ngame executable is specified.\n\nThis also works if the game is started from the freedesktop_ menu, because\nfreedesktop .desktop files usually don't specify a full path to the executable\n(when they do, the only recourse is to fix the .desktop file manually and\nreport a bug to the game in question). The format of .desktop files is\ndescribed in the `Desktop Entry specification`_.\n\nflo-check-homework-decorate-games has options to customize the paths such as\n/usr/games and /usr/local/games, as well as options to choose which locale to\nuse when a launcher script starts flo-check-homework, and when\nflo-check-homework runs a game. See the output of\n'flo-check-homework-decorate-games --help' for more information.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nThe following software is required to run flo-check-homework:\n\n  - Python\u00a03.1 or later in the 3 series;\n  - Qt\u00a04.8 or later;\n  - PyQt\u00a04.10.3 is known to work, version 4.9 should be enough and older\n    versions will most probably not work with this version of\n    flo-check-homework.\n\nVersion 0.9.12 of flo-check-homework has been tested on Linux with\nPython\u00a03.3.2, Qt\u00a04.8.2 and PyQt\u00a04.10.3. It should work on any platform with\nthe aforementioned dependencies installed, but trivial bugs are likely to pop\nup on non-Unix platforms as no test whatsoever has been done on them. Please\nreport.\n\nFor installation instructions, please refer to INSTALL.txt.\n\n\nRunning flo-check-homework from the Git repository\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nflo-check-homework is maintained in a `Git repository\n<https://github.com/frougon/flo-check-homework>`_ that can be cloned with::\n\n  git clone https://github.com/frougon/flo-check-homework\n\nIt is possible to run flo-check-homework from a clone of that repository, but\ntwo things that are not part of it have to be set up in order for everything\nto work properly:\n\n  - the flo_check_homework/images directory tree containing \u201creward images\u201d\n    must be copied from a release tarball, otherwise there will be an error\n    when all questions have been answered and the program tries to show an\n    image;\n  - the .qm files (used for translations) that are relevant to your locale\n    settings must be generated from the corresponding .ts source files; this\n    can be done automatically with the Makefile shipped in the top-level\n    directory of the Git repository, provided you have GNU Make (run 'make').\n\n\nAdditional notes\n----------------\n\nSince flo-check-homework-decorate-games is currently only able to generate\nshell scripts, it is not expected to be of any use on platforms that cannot\nrun them. This means that you can fill in questionnaires on these platforms\nbut can't expect to be able to run the desired program/games from\nflo-check-homework after a good enough work without some adaptation for such\nplatforms. (For Windows platforms, one might use Cygwin or adapt\nflo-check-homework-decorate-games to generate batch files, or something else,\nlet Windows experts decide in this matter...)\n\nAll images, as the rest of the package, are free according to the `Debian Free\nSoftware Guidelines`_ (DFSG-free for short). I wanted to use photos of\nangry-looking dogs easily found with Google Images, but unfortunately, they\nall appear to be non-free. If you have good suggestions of free\nsoftware-licensed images to improve this program, please advise.\n\n\n.. _freedesktop: http://www.freedesktop.org/\n.. _Desktop Entry specification: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec\n.. _Debian Free Software Guidelines: http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines",
