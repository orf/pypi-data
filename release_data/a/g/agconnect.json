            "description": "# Huawei AppGallery Connect Python Server SDK for Auth\n\n## Overview\n\nMost apps need to identify and authenticate users to tailor the app experience for individual users. However, building such a system from scratch is a difficult process. Auth Service can quickly build a secure and reliable user authentication system for your app. You only need to access Auth Service capabilities in your app without caring about the facilities and implementation on the cloud.\n\nFor more information, visit the [Auth Service Introduction](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-auth-introduction-0000001053732605).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the agconnect via PyPi\n\n    pip install agconnect\n\nAfter the installation takes place, you can import the package as shown below\n\n    from agconnect.auth_server import AGCAuth\n\n# Supported Environments\n\nThis project supports Python version 3.6 or higher\n\nAlso note that the Huawei AppGallery Connect Python Server SDK should only be used in server-side/back-end environments controlled by the application developer.This includes most server and serverless platforms. Do not use the Python Server SDK environment in the client.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Getting Started with the Server](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-auth-introduction-0000001053732605)\n- [Reference](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-auth-introduction-0000001053732605)\n\n## License\n\nHuawei AppGallery Connect Python Server SDK for Auth is licensed under the \"ISC\".\n\n## Keywords\n\n[agconnect](https://pypi.org/search/?q=agconnect&o=)\n\n[python](https://pypi.org/search/?q=python&o=) \n\n[server sdk](https://pypi.org/search/?q=server+sdk&o=)\n\n[authentication](https://pypi.org/search/?q=authentication&o=)",
