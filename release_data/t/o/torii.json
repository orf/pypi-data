It has merged several of the components that were separate into a single package, and also adds new functionality, as well as some internal changes for better integration into tooling.\n\nThe evaluation board definitions have also been migrated and are located in the [torii-boards](https://github.com/shrine-maiden-heavy-industries/torii-boards) repository.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nPlease see the [Torii Introduction](https://shrine-maiden-heavy-industries.github.io/torii-hdl/intro.html) on the [online documentation](https://shrine-maiden-heavy-industries.github.io/torii-hdl/)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nPlease see the [installation instructions](https://shrine-maiden-heavy-industries.github.io/torii-hdl/install.html) on the [online documentation](https://shrine-maiden-heavy-industries.github.io/torii-hdl/)\n\n## Supported devices\n\nTorii can be used to target any FPGA or ASIC process that accepts behavioral Verilog-2001 as input. It also offers extended support for many FPGA families, providing toolchain integration, abstractions for device-specific primitives, and more. Specifically:\n\n  * Lattice iCE40 (toolchains: **Yosys+nextpnr**, LSE-iCECube2, Synplify-iCECube2);\n  * Lattice MachXO2 (toolchains: Diamond);\n  * Lattice MachXO3L (toolchains: Diamond);\n  * Lattice ECP5 (toolchains: **Yosys+nextpnr**, Diamond);\n  * Xilinx Spartan 3A (toolchains: ISE);\n  * Xilinx Spartan 6 (toolchains: ISE);\n  * Xilinx 7-series (toolchains: Vivado);\n  * Xilinx UltraScale (toolchains: Vivado);\n  * Intel (toolchains: Quartus);\n  * Quicklogic EOS S3 (toolchains: **Yosys+VPR**).\n\nFOSS toolchains are listed in **bold**.\n\n\n## License\n\nTorii is released under the [BSD-2-Clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html), the full text of which can be found in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n",
