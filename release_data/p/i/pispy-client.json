What? Is this pispy or pispy-client? Why the two names?\n\nWell... when I started hacking this together I went to check if PyPi had a\npackage called `pispy` and it didn't, so I steamed ahead with that. Only\nwhen I came to add the package to PyPi did it say it wouldn't let me because\nit was too similar to another package.\n\nSo... package name is `pispy-client` but the content is `pispy`.\n\n## Work in progress\n\nPISpy is currently a work in progress. I'm still figuring out what it should\ndo and how; but for now it provides a simple package lookup interface.\n\n[//]: # (README.md ends here)\n",
