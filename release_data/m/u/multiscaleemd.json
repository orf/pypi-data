            "description": "Implementation of Multiscale EMD Methods\n========================================\n\nMultiscale Earth Mover's Distances embeds the Wasserstein distance between two distributions into $L^1$. For each distribution we build an embedding where the $L^1$ distance between embeddings equivalent to the Earth Mover's Distance between distributions. This creates a geometry between distributions which can be exploited to find EMD-nearest-neighbors in sub-linear time.\n\nWe offer two main types of MultiscaleEMDs at the moment:\n\n* DiffusionEMD which embeds the Wasserstein distance between two distributions on a graph approximately into $L^1$ in log-linear time.\n* TreeEMD / Trellis which embeds the Wasserstein distance between distributions over a tree exactly into $L^1$. TreeEMD / Trellis also provides utilities for building a tree over data in represented in $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$ using divisive hierarchical clustering. Where TreeEMD computes the Wasserstein distance, Trellis extends this to the Kantorovich-Rubenstein distance between treatment distribution changes.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nMultiscaleEMD is available in `pypi`. Install by running the following::\n\n    pip install MultiscaleEMD\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nMultiscaleEMD is written following the `sklearn` estimator framework.\n\nFor DiffusionEMD: We provide two functions that operate quite differently. First the Chebyshev approximation of the operator in `DiffusionCheb`, which we recommend when the number of distributions is small compared to the number of points. Second, the Interpolative Decomposition method that computes dyadic powers of $P^{2^k}$ directly in `DiffusionTree`. These two classes are used in the same way, first supplying parameters, fitting to a graph and array of distributions::\n\n    import numpy as np\n    from DiffusionEMD import DiffusionCheb\n\n    # Setup an adjacency matrix and a set of distributions to embed\n    adj = np.ones((10, 10))\n    distributions = np.random.randn(10, 5)\n    dc = DiffusionCheb()\n\n    # Embeddings where the L1 distance approximates the Earth Mover's Distance\n    embeddings = dc.fit_transform(adj, distributions)\n    # Shape: (5, 60)\n\nFor Tree Earth Mover's Distances and Trellis: we provide a number of ways to embed pointcloud data in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ into a hierarchical tree. These are implemented as options in the `MetricTree` class.\n\nRequirements can be found in `requirements.txt`\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nExamples are in the `notebooks` directory.\n\nTake a look at the examples provided there to get a sense of how the parameters\nbehave on simple examples that are easy to visualize.\n\nPaper\n-----\n\nThis code implements the algorithms described in this paper:\n\nArXiv Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12833::\n\n    @InProceedings{pmlr-v139-tong21a,\n      title =       {Diffusion Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and Distribution Embeddings},\n      author =      {Tong, Alexander and Huguet, Guillaume and Natik, Amine and Macdonald, Kincaid and Kuchroo, Manik and Coifman, Ronald and Wolf, Guy and Krishnaswamy, Smita},\n      booktitle =   {Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning},\n      pages = \t    {10336--10346},\n      year = \t    {2021},\n      editor = \t    {Meila, Marina and Zhang, Tong},\n      volume = \t    {139},\n      series = \t    {Proceedings of Machine Learning Research},\n      month = \t    {18--24 Jul},\n      publisher =   {PMLR},\n      pdf = \t    {http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/tong21a/tong21a.pdf},\n      url = \t    {http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/tong21a.html},\n    }\n\nAnd this paper:\n\nArXiv Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12334::\n\n    @inproceedings{tong_embedding_2022,\n      author={Tong, Alexander and Huguet, Guillaume and Shung, Dennis and Natik, Amine and Kuchroo, Manik and Lajoie, Guillaume and Wolf, Guy and Krishnaswamy, Smita},\n      booktitle={ICASSP 2022 - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)},\n      title={Embedding Signals on Graphs with Unbalanced Diffusion Earth Mover&#x2019;s Distance},\n      year={2022},\n      volume={},\n      number={},\n      pages={5647-5651},\n      doi={10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746556}\n    }\n\nAs well as other algorithms under development.\n\n\n",
