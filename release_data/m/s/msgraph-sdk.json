            "description": "# Microsoft Graph SDK for Python\n\nGet started with the Microsoft Graph SDK for Python by integrating the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview) into your Python application.\n\n> **Note:** this SDK allows you to build applications using the [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/use-the-api#version) of Microsoft Graph. If you want to try the latest Microsoft Graph APIs, try the [Beta](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-python) SDK.\n>\n> **Note:** the Microsoft Graph Python SDK is currently in public preview.\n\n## 1. Installation\n\n```py\npip install msgraph-sdk-python\n```\n\n## 2. Getting started with Microsoft Graph\n\n### 2.1 Register your application\n\nRegister your application by following the steps at [Register your app with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/auth-register-app-v2).\n\n### 2.2 Create an AuthenticationProvider object\n\nAn instance of the **GraphServiceClient** class handles building client. To create a new instance of this class, you need to provide an instance of **AuthenticationProvider**, which can authenticate requests to Microsoft Graph.\n\n> **Note**: This SDK offers an asynchronous API by default. Async is a concurrency model that is far more efficient than multi-threading, and can provide significant performance benefits and enable the use of long-lived network connections such as WebSockets. We support popular python async envronments such as `asyncio`, `anyio` or `trio`. For authentication you need to use one of the async credential classes from `azure.identity`.\n\n```py\nfrom azure.identity.aio import EnvironmentCredential\nfrom kiota_authentication_azure.azure_identity_authentication_provider import AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider\n\ncredential=EnvironmentCredential()\nauth_provider = AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider(credential)\n```\n\n### 2.3 Initialise a GraphRequestAdapter object\n\nThe SDK uses an adapter object that handles the HTTP concerns. This HTTP adapter object is used to build the Graph client for making requests.\n\nTo initialise one using the authentication provider created in the previous step:\n\n```py\nfrom msgraph.graph_request_adapter import GraphRequestAdapter\n\nadapter = GraphRequestAdapter(auth_provider)\n```\n\nWe currently use [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) as our HTTP client. You can pass your custom configured `httpx.AsyncClient` using:\n\n```py\nfrom msgraph.graph_request_adapter import GraphRequestAdapter\nfrom msgraph.core.graph_client_factory import GraphClientFactory\n\nhttp_Client = GraphClientFactory::create_with_default_middleware(client=httpx.AsyncClient())\nrequest_adapter = GraphRequestAdapter(auth_Provider, http_client)\n```\n\n### 2.3 Get a GraphServiceClient object\n\nYou must get a **GraphServiceClient** object to make requests against the service.\n\n```py\nfrom msgraph.graph_service_client import GraphServiceClient\n\nclient = GraphServiceClient(request_adapter)\n```\n\n## 3. Make requests against the service\n\nAfter you have a **GraphServiceClient** that is authenticated, you can begin making calls against the service. The requests against the service look like our [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).\n\nThe following is a complete example that shows how to fetch a user from Microsoft Graph.\n\n```py\nimport asyncio\nfrom azure.identity.aio import ClientSecretCredential\nfrom kiota_authentication_azure.azure_identity_authentication_provider import AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider\nfrom msgraph.graph_request_adapter import GraphRequestAdapter\nfrom msgraph.graph_service_client import GraphServiceClient\n\ncredential = ClientSecretCredential(\n    'tenant_id',\n    'client_id',\n    'client_secret'\n)\nauth_provider = AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider(credential)\nrequest_adapter = GraphRequestAdapter(auth_provider)\nclient = GraphServiceClient(request_adapter)\n\nuser = asyncio.run(client.users_by_id('userPrincipalName').get())\nprint(user.display_name)\n```\n\nNote that to calling `me()` requires a signed-in user and therefore delegated permissions (obtained using the `authorization_code` flow):\n\n```py\nimport asyncio\nfrom azure.identity.aio import AuthorizationCodeCredential\nfrom kiota_authentication_azure.azure_identity_authentication_provider import AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider\nfrom msgraph.graph_request_adapter import GraphRequestAdapter\nfrom msgraph.graph_service_client import GraphServiceClient\n\ncredential = AuthorizationCodeCredential(\n    'tenant_id',\n    'client_id',\n    'authorization_code',\n    'redirect_uri',\n)\n\nauth_provider = AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider(credential)\nrequest_adapter = GraphRequestAdapter(auth_provider)\nclient = GraphServiceClient(request_adapter)\n\nuser = asyncio.run(client.me().get())\nprint(user.display_name)\n\n```\n## Documentation and resources\n\n* [Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview)\n\n* [Microsoft Graph website](https://aka.ms/graph)\n\n## Upgrading\n\nFor detailed information on breaking changes, bug fixes and new functionality introduced during major upgrades, check out our [Upgrade Guide](UPGRADING.md)\n\n\n## Issues\n\nView or log issues on the [Issues](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python/issues) tab in the repo.\n\n## Contribute\n\nPlease read our [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines carefully for advice on how to contribute to this repo.\n\n## Copyright and license\n\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
