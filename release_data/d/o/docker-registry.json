Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If you are looking for the next-generation of docker distribution tools (including the new golang registry), please head over to [docker/distribution](https://github.com/docker/distribution) instead.*\n\nDocker-Registry\n===============\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/docker/docker-registry.png)](https://travis-ci.org/docker/docker-registry)\n\nAbout this document\n===================\n\nAs the documentation evolves with different registry versions, be sure that before reading any further you:\n\n * check which version of the registry you are running\n * switch to the corresponding tag to access the README that matches your product version\n\nThe stable, released version is the [0.9.1 tag](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry/tree/0.9.1).\n\nPlease also have a quick look at the [FAQ](FAQ.md) before reporting bugs.\n\n# Table of Contents\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Configuration mechanism overview](#configuration-mechanism-overview)\n- [Configuration flavors](#configuration-flavors)\n  - [Example config](#example-config)\n- [Available configuration options](#available-configuration-options)\n  - [General options](#general-options)\n    - [Authentication options](#authentication-options)\n    - [Search-engine options](#search-engine-options)\n      - [sqlalchemy](#sqlalchemy)\n    - [Mirroring Options](#mirroring-options)\n    - [Cache options](#cache-options)\n    - [Storage options](#storage-options)\n      - [storage file](#storage-file)\n        - [Persistent storage](#persistent-storage)\n      - [storage s3](#storage-s3)\n- [Your own config](#your-own-config)\n- [Advanced use](#advanced-user)\n- [Drivers](#drivers)\n- [For developers](#for-developers)\n\n# Quick start\n\nThe fastest way to get running:\n\n * [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation)\n * run the registry: `docker run -p 5000:5000 registry`\n\nThat will use the [official image from the Docker hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/registry/).\n\nHere is a slightly more complex example that launches a registry on port 5000, using an Amazon S3 bucket to store images with a custom path, and enables the search endpoint:\n\n```\ndocker run \\\n         -e SETTINGS_FLAVOR=s3 \\\n         -e AWS_BUCKET=mybucket \\\n         -e STORAGE_PATH=/registry \\\n         -e AWS_KEY=myawskey \\\n         -e AWS_SECRET=myawssecret \\\n         -e SEARCH_BACKEND=sqlalchemy \\\n         -p 5000:5000 \\\n         registry\n```\n\n\n# Configuration mechanism overview\n\nBy default, the registry will use the [config_sample.yml](config/config_sample.yml) configuration to start.\n\nIndividual configuration options from that file may be overridden using environment variables. Example: `docker run -e STORAGE_PATH=/registry`.\n\nYou may also use different \"flavors\" from that file (see below).\n\nFinally, you can use your own configuration file (see below).\n\n\n# Configuration flavors\n\nThe registry can be instructed to use a specific flavor from a configuration file.\n\nThis mechanism lets you define different running \"mode\" (eg: \"development\", \"production\" or anything else).\n\nIn the `config_sample.yml` file, you'll see several sample flavors:\n\n1. `common`: used by all other flavors as base settings\n1. `local`: stores data on the local filesystem\n1. `s3`: stores data in an AWS S3 bucket\n1. `ceph-s3`: stores data in a Ceph cluster via a Ceph Object Gateway, using the S3 API\n1. `azureblob`: stores data in an Microsoft Azure Blob Storage ([(docs)](ADVANCED.md))\n1. `dev`: basic configuration using the `local` flavor\n1. `test`: used by unit tests\n1. `prod`: production configuration (basically a synonym for the `s3` flavor)\n1. `gcs`: stores data in Google cloud storage\n1. `swift`: stores data in OpenStack Swift\n1. `glance`: stores data in OpenStack Glance, with a fallback to local storage\n1. `glance-swift`: stores data in OpenStack Glance, with a fallback to Swift\n1. `elliptics`: stores data in Elliptics key/value storage\n\nYou can define your own flavors by adding a new top-level yaml key.\n\nTo specify which flavor you want to run, set the `SETTINGS_FLAVOR`\nenvironment variable: `export SETTINGS_FLAVOR=dev`\n\nThe default flavor is `dev`.\n\nNOTE: it's possible to load environment variables from within the config file\nwith a simple syntax: `_env:VARIABLENAME[:DEFAULT]`. Check this syntax\nin action in the example below...\n\n\n## Example config\n\n```yaml\n\ncommon: &common\n    standalone: true\n    loglevel: info\n    search_backend: \"_env:SEARCH_BACKEND:\"\n    sqlalchemy_index_database:\n        \"_env:SQLALCHEMY_INDEX_DATABASE:sqlite:////tmp/docker-registry.db\"\n\nprod:\n    <<: *common\n    loglevel: warn\n    storage: s3\n    s3_access_key: _env:AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY\n    s3_secret_key: _env:AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY\n    s3_bucket: _env:AWS_S3_BUCKET\n    boto_bucket: _env:AWS_S3_BUCKET\n    storage_path: /srv/docker\n    smtp_host: localhost\n    from_addr: docker@myself.com\n    to_addr: my@myself.com\n\ndev:\n    <<: *common\n    loglevel: debug\n    storage: local\n    storage_path: /home/myself/docker\n\ntest:\n    <<: *common\n    storage: local\n    storage_path: /tmp/tmpdockertmp\n```\n\n\n\n# Available configuration options\n\nWhen using the `config_sample.yml`, you can pass all options through as environment variables. See [`config_sample.yml`](config/config_sample.yml) for the mapping.\n\n## General options\n\n1. `loglevel`: string, level of debugging. Any of python's\n   [logging](http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) module levels:\n   `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` or `critical`\n1. `debug`: boolean, make the `/_ping` endpoint output more useful information, such as library versions and host information.\n1. `storage_redirect`: Redirect resource requested if storage engine supports\n   this, e.g. S3 will redirect signed URLs, this can be used to offload the\n   server.\n1. `boto_host`/`boto_port`: If you are using `storage: s3` the\n   [standard boto config file locations](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html#details)\n   (`/etc/boto.cfg, ~/.boto`) will be used.  If you are using a\n   *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store (such as Ceph), in one of the boto config files'\n   `[Credentials]` section, set `boto_host`, `boto_port` as appropriate for the\n   service you are using. Alternatively, set `boto_host` and `boto_port` in the config file.\n\n## Authentication options\n\n1. `standalone`: boolean, run the server in stand-alone mode. This means that\n   the Index service on index.docker.io will not be used for anything. This\n   implies `disable_token_auth`.\n\n1. `index_endpoint`: string, configures the hostname of the Index endpoint.\n   This is used to verify passwords of users that log in. It defaults to\n   https://index.docker.io. You should probably leave this to its default.\n\n1. `disable_token_auth`: boolean, disable checking of tokens with the Docker\n   index. You should provide your own method of authentication (such as Basic\n   auth).\n\n## Search-engine options\n\nThe Docker Registry can optionally index repository information in a\ndatabase for the `GET /v1/search` [endpoint][search-endpoint].  You\ncan configure the backend with a configuration like:\n\nThe `search_backend` setting selects the search backend to use.  If\n`search_backend` is empty, no index is built, and the search endpoint always\nreturns empty results.\n\n1. `search_backend`: The name of the search backend engine to use.\n   Currently supported backends are:\n   1. `sqlalchemy`\n\nIf `search_backend` is neither empty nor one of the supported backends, it\nshould point to a module.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\ncommon:\n  search_backend: foo.registry.index.xapian\n```\n\nIn this case, the module is imported, and an instance of its `Index`\nclass is used as the search backend.\n\n### sqlalchemy\n\nUse [SQLAlchemy][] as the search backend.\n\n1. `sqlalchemy_index_database`: The database URL passed through to\n   [create_engine][].\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\ncommon:\n  search_backend: sqlalchemy\n  sqlalchemy_index_database: sqlite:////tmp/docker-registry.db\n```\n\nOn initialization, the `SQLAlchemyIndex` class checks the database\nversion.  If the database doesn't exist yet (or does exist, but lacks\na `version` table), the `SQLAlchemyIndex` creates the database and\nrequired tables.\n\n## Mirroring Options\n\nAll mirror options are placed in a `mirroring` section.\n\n1. `mirroring`:\n  1. `source`:\n  1. `source_index`:\n  1. `tags_cache_ttl`:\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\ncommon:\n  mirroring:\n    source: https://registry-1.docker.io\n    source_index: https://index.docker.io\n    tags_cache_ttl: 172800 # 2 days\n```\n\n## Cache options\n\nIt's possible to add an LRU cache to access small files. In this case you need\nto spawn a [redis-server](http://redis.io/) configured in\n[LRU mode](http://redis.io/topics/config). The config file \"config_sample.yml\"\nshows an example to enable the LRU cache using the config directive `cache_lru`.\n\nOnce this feature is enabled, all small files (tags, meta-data) will be cached\nin Redis. When using a remote storage backend (like Amazon S3), it will speed\nthings up dramatically since it will reduce roundtrips to S3.\n\nAll config settings are placed in a `cache` or `cache_lru` section.\n\n1. `cache`/`cache_lru`:\n  1. `host`: Host address of server\n  1. `port`: Port server listens on\n  1. `password`: Authentication password\n\n\n\n## Storage options\n\n`storage` selects the storage engine to use. The registry ships with two storage engine by default (`file` and `s3`).\n\nIf you want to find other (community provided) storages: `pip search docker-registry-driver`\n\nTo use and install one of these alternate storages:\n\n * `pip install docker-registry-driver-NAME`\n * in the configuration set `storage` to `NAME`\n * add any other storage dependent configuration option to the conf file\n * review the storage specific documentation for additional dependency or configuration instructions.\n\n Currently, we are aware of the following storage drivers:\n\n  * [azure](https://github.com/ahmetalpbalkan/docker-registry-driver-azure)\n  * [elliptics](https://github.com/noxiouz/docker-registry-driver-elliptics)\n  * [swift](https://github.com/bacongobbler/docker-registry-driver-swift)\n  * [gcs](https://github.com/dmp42/docker-registry-driver-gcs)\n  * [glance](https://github.com/dmp42/docker-registry-driver-glance)\n  * [oss](https://github.com/chris-jin/docker-registry-driver-alioss.git)\n\n### storage file\n\n1. `storage_path`: Path on the filesystem where to store data\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nlocal:\n  storage: file\n  storage_path: /mnt/registry\n```\n\n#### Persistent storage\nIf you use any type of local store along with a registry running within a docker\nremember to use a data volume for the `storage_path`. Please read the documentation\nfor [data volumes](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/working_with_volumes/) for more information.\n\nExample:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 5000 -v /tmp/registry:/tmp/registry registry\n```\n\n### storage s3\nAWS Simple Storage Service options\n\n1. `s3_access_key`: string, S3 access key\n1. `s3_secret_key`: string, S3 secret key\n1. `s3_bucket`: string, S3 bucket name\n1. `s3_region`: S3 region where the bucket is located\n1. `s3_encrypt`: boolean, if true, the container will be encrypted on the\n      server-side by S3 and will be stored in an encrypted form while at rest\n      in S3.\n1. `s3_secure`: boolean, true for HTTPS to S3\n1. `s3_use_sigv4`: boolean, true for USE_SIGV4 (boto_host needs to be set or use_sigv4 will be ignored by boto.)\n1. `boto_bucket`: string, the bucket name for *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store\n1. `boto_host`: string, host for *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store\n1. `boto_port`: for *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store\n1. `boto_debug`: for *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store\n1. `boto_calling_format`: string, the fully qualified class name of the boto calling format to use when accessing S3 or a *non*-Amazon S3-compliant object store\n1. `storage_path`: string, the sub \"folder\" where image data will be stored.\n\nExample:\n```yaml\nprod:\n  storage: s3\n  s3_region: us-west-1\n  s3_bucket: acme-docker\n  storage_path: /registry\n  s3_access_key: AKIAHSHB43HS3J92MXZ\n  s3_secret_key: xdDowwlK7TJajV1Y7EoOZrmuPEJlHYcNP2k4j49T\n```\n\n# Your own config\n\nStart from a copy of [config_sample.yml](config/config_sample.yml).\n\nThen, start your registry with a mount point to expose your new configuration inside the container (`-v /home/me/myfolder:/registry-conf`), and point to it using the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_CONFIG` environment variable:\n\n```\nsudo docker run -p 5000:5000 -v /home/me/myfolder:/registry-conf -e DOCKER_REGISTRY_CONFIG=/registry-conf/mysuperconfig.yml registry\n```\n\n# Advanced use\n\nFor more features and advanced options, have a look at the [advanced features documentation](ADVANCED.md)\n\n# Drivers\n\nFor more backend drivers, please read [drivers.md](DRIVERS.md)\n\n# For developers\n\nRead [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n[search-endpoint]: http://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker-io_api/#search\n[SQLAlchemy]: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/\n[create_engine]: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine",
