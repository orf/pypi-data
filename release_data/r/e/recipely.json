            "description": "# Based Cooking Website\n\n[https://based.cooking](https://based.cooking)\n\nThis is a simple cooking website where users can submit recipes here for credit.\nThere are no ads, trackers, cookies (unless recipes thereof) or javascript.\n\n## Ways to contribute\n\n- By adding a recipe.\n- Make a recipe and take a nice picture of it if no nice picture already\n  exists. Submitted images should be small `.webp` files ideally less than 100K\n  or so.\n- Fix errors in recipes or add minor improvements.\n\n## Rules for submission\n\n- Model submission files after [example.md](example.md). Put them in `src/`.\n- Recipes should start with a title, with a single `#`, *on the first line*. No\n  empty line at the top, no trailing line at the end. The file needs to be `\\n`\n  terminated in linux-fashion (if you're on linux you don't need to care, it\n  should be automatic).\n- File names should be the name of the dish with words separated by hyphens\n  (`-`). Not underscores, and definitely not spaces.\n- Recipe must be based, i.e. good traditional and substantial food. Nothing\n  ironic, meme-tier hyper-sugary, meat-substitute, etc.\n- Don't include salt and pepper and other ubiquitous things in the ingredients\n  list.\n\n**If you fail to do these things, I will close your submission and you will have to resubmit. I am tired of having to fix more than 50% of submissions.**\n\n### Tags\n\nYou can (and should) add tags at the end of your recipe. The syntax is:\n```\n;tags: tag1 tag2 tag3\n```\n\nThe tag line should be a single line, at the end of the markdown file, preceded\nby a blank line.\n\nAdd between 1 and 4 tags, **prioritize existing tags**. As a general guideline,\nadd the country from which the recipe originates if the recipe is representative\nof said country, using the adjective form (eg. *mexican*, *italian*, etc). Tag\nthe main ingredient if it's something slightly special.\n\nList of special, categorical tags to use if relevant:\n- `basic`: for basic recipes that aren't meant to be stand alone but are supposed\n  to be incorporated in another recipe.\n- `breakfast`\n- `dessert`\n- `quick`: for recipes that can be cooked in under ~20 minutes.\n- `side`: side dishes such as mash, fries, etc.\n- `snack`\n- `spread`\n\nIf your recipe contains no meat or dairy, include the `fasting` tag.\nIf it includes dairy but no milk, incude the `cheesefare` tag.\n\n### Images\n\nImages are stored in `data/pix`.\n\nEach recipe can have a title image at the top and perhaps\nseveral instructional images as absolutely necessary.\n\nDo not add stock images you found on the internet.\nTake a good picture yourself of the actual dish created.\nIf you see a bad or substandard image, you may submit a better one.\n\nImages should be in `.webp` format and with as small file size as possible.\nIf you submit an image for say, `chicken-parmesan.md`, it should be added as `pix/chicken-parmesan.webp`.\n\nIf you would like to add additional directional images,\nthey should be numbered with two digits like: `pix/chicken-parmesan-01.webp`, etc.\n\n## About the site\n\nThe front page, for now, will just be a list of recipes automatically generated\nfrom the content of `src`.\nAs more articles are added, the site will be reorganized, categorized\nor will implement server-side scripting or searches.\nThis is not necessary yet though.\n\nI don't really want images of recipes on the mainpage yet.\nI'll think about how best to do it to minimize bandwidth if possible.\n\n## License\n\nThis website and all its content is in the public domain.\nBy submitting text or images or anything else to this repository,\nyou waive any pretense of ownership to it,\nalthough you are welcome and recommended to give yourself credit\nat the bottom of a submitted page for you adding it\n(including personal or donation links).\n",
