Balder's goal is\nbeing a platform for combining the single steps of defining, developing and documenting the entire test \nprocess while using test scenarios which can be reused across different projects.\n\nYou can share your own testcode by creating a new BalderHub project, or you use an existing BalderHub project, by simply \ninstalling and using it. This makes the test development for your project much faster, since it is often times enough to \nonly provide the user-specific code.\n\nBe part of the progress and share your tests with others, your company or the whole world.\n\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can install the latest release with pip:\n\n```\npython -m pip install baldertest\n```\n\n# Run Balder\n\nAfter you've installed it, you can run Balder inside a Balder environment with the following command:\n\n```\nbalder\n```\n\nYou can also provide a specific path to the balder environment directory by using this console argument:\n\n```\nbalder --working-dir /path/to/working/dir\n```\n\n# Contribution guidelines\n\nAny help is appreciated. If you want to contribute to balder, take a look into the \n[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/balder-dev/balder/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nBalder is still in its early steps. Unfortunately, this also means that we don't have a broad variety of BalderHub \nprojects at the moment.\n\nAre you an expert in your field? Do you enjoy the concept of balder? How about you create your own\nBalderHub project? Take a look into our [Balder GitHub Group](https://github.com/balder-dev) and feel free to share \nyour ideas. You can contribute to an existing project or create your own. If you are not sure, a project for your idea \nalready exists or if you want to discuss your ideas with others, feel free to\n[create an issue in the BalderHub main entry project](https://github.com/balder-dev/hub.balder.dev/issues) or\n[start a new discussion](https://github.com/balder-dev/hub.balder.dev/discussions).\n\n# License\n\nBalder is free and Open-Source\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Max Stahlschmidt and others\n\nDistributed under the terms of the MIT license\n",
