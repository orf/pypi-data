            "description": "# geo-rasterize: a 2D rasterizer for geospatial applications, written in Rust\n\n[![PyPI][pypi-badge]][pypi-url]\n[![Build Status][actions-badge]][actions-url]\n\n[pypi-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/geo-rasterize\n[pypi-url]: https://pypi.org/project/geo-rasterize/\n[actions-badge]: https://github.com/msalib/py-geo-rasterize/actions/workflows/Release.yml/badge.svg\n[actions-url]: https://github.com/msalib/py-geo-rasterize/actions?query=Release+branch%3Amain\n\n`geo-rasterize` is a Python wrapper for a [rust library with the same\nname](https://crates.io/crates/geo-rasterize) that rasterizes\n[shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project.html)\nvector shapes, just like\n[rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/)'s\n[features.rasterize](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.features.html#rasterio.features.rasterize). The\ndifference is that while [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/)\nis built on GDAL, this library has no dependencies -- you can install\nit without having to worry about GDAL (or any other C library at all)!\nPlus `geo-rasterize`'s rasterization algorithm is based on GDAL's so\nit should be a drop in replacement for `rasterio.features.rasterize`\nand it offers a very similar API.\n\nWe publish wheels to PyPI Python 3.7+ for the following platforms:\n\n| Operating System | Architecture                    |\n|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Linux            | x86-64                          |\n| Linux            | i686                            |\n| Linux            | aarch64                         |\n| Windows          | x86-64                          |\n| Windows          | i686                            |\n| MacOS            | Universal2 (x86-64 and aarch64) |\n\n\n## Examples\n\nFor example, let's rasterize a single `Point` located at `(x=1, y=2)`\nonto a raster that is 5 pixels wide and 6 pixels high. By default, the\nraster pixels will start out with value zero, and we'll put a `1` in\nevery pixel the point touches:\n\n```python\n>>> from shapely.geometry import Point\n>>> from geo_rasterize import rasterize\n>>> print(rasterize([Point(1, 2)], [1], (5, 6)))\n[[0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 1 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n```\n\nAnd the result is just what we expect: a 5x6 `numpy` array with\nexactly one pixel set to 1! Note that we had to specify a list of\nshapes rather than just one shape. And the list of foreground values\n(`[1]` in this case) has to have the same length since we'll need one\nforeground value for each shape.\n\nSo let's see multiple shapes!\n```python\n>>> from shapely.geometry import Point, LineString\n>>> from geo_rasterize import rasterize\n>>> shapes = [Point(3, 4), LineString([(0, 3), (3, 0)])]\n>>> foregrounds = [3, 7]\n>>> raster_size = (4, 5)\n>>> print(rasterize(shapes, foregrounds, raster_size))\n[[0 0 7 0]\n [0 7 7 0]\n [7 7 0 0]\n [7 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 3]]\n\n```\n\nWhat happens when two shapes burn in the same pixel? That depends on\nhow you set the merge algorithm, given by the `algorithm`\nparameter. The default is `'replace'` which means the last shape\noverwrites the pixel but you can also set it to `'add'` to that\nforeground values will sum. That allows you to make heatmaps!\n\n```python\n>>> from shapely.geometry import Point, LineString\n>>> from geo_rasterize import rasterize\n>>> shapes = [LineString([(0, 0), (5, 5)]), LineString([(5, 0), (0, 5)])]\n>>> print(rasterize(shapes, [1, 1], (5, 5), algorithm='add'))\n[[1 0 0 0 1]\n [0 1 0 1 1]\n [0 0 2 1 0]\n [0 1 1 1 0]\n [1 1 0 0 1]]\n\n```\n\nOur two lines cross at the center where you'll find `2`.\n\nYou can change the default value using the `background` parameter. And\nyou can set the array `dtype` using the `dtype` parameter. Setting\n`dtype='uint8'` will reduce the space needed for your raster array by\n8x. This is especially useful if you're only interested in binary\nrasterization.\n\n## Geographic transforms\n\nAll our examples so far have assumed that our shapes' coordinates are\nin the image space. In other words, we've assumed that the `x`\ncoordinates will be in the range `0..width` and the `y` coordinates\nwill be in the range `0..height`. Alas, that is often not the case!\n\nFor satellite imagery (or remote sensing imagery in general), images\nwill almost always specify both a Coordinate Reference System\n([CRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system)) and an\naffine transformation in their metadata. See [rasterio's\nGeoreferencing](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/georeferencing.html)\nfor more details.\n\nIn order to work with most imagery, you have to convert your vector\nshapes from whatever their original CRS is (often `EPSG:4326` for\ngeographic longitude and latitude) into whatever CRS your data file\nspecifies (often a\n[UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system)\nprojection but there are so many choices). Then, you need to apply an\naffine transformation to convert from world coordinates to pixel\ncoordinates. Since raster imagery usually specifies the inverse\ntransformation matrix (i.e. a `pix_to_geo` transform), you'll first\nneed to invert it to get a `geo_to_pix` transform before applying it\nto the coordinates. And now you've got pixel coordinates appropriate\nfor your image data!\n\n`geo-raterize` can ease this tedious process by taking care of the\naffine transformation. Just pass an affine transform array using the\n`geo_to_pix` parameter (call `.to_gdal()` if you have an\n`affine.Affine` instance).\n\nTo summarize, you'll have to:\n\n* extract the CRS from your image and convert your shapes into that\n  CRS (probably using [pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/)\n  and its integration with [geo types][geo],\n* extract the `pix_to_geo` transform from your imagery metadata\n* create an `Affine` instance from that data (GDAL represents these\n  as a `[f64; 6]` array and you can use `Affine.from_gdal`)\n* call `transform.inverse` to get the corresponding `geo_to_pix`\n  transform (remember that not all transforms are invertible!)\n* call `transform.to_gdal()` and use the resulting array with the\n  `geo_to_pix` parameter\n\n",
