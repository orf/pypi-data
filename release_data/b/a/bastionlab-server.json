When collaborating remotely, data owners had to open their whole dataset, often through a Jupyter notebook. This was dangerous because too many operations were allowed and the data scientist had numerous ways to extract information from the remote infrastructure (print the whole database, save the dataset in the weights, etc).\n\nBastionLab solves this problem by ensuring that only privacy-friendly operations are allowed on the data and anonymized outputs are shown to the data scientist. \n\n**BastionLab is an open-source project.** Our solution is coded in Rust and uses Polars, a pandas-like library for data exploration.\n\n>  **Disclaimer**: BastionAI, our fortified learning framework using TEEs will be incorporated in the broader offers of BastionLab, a holistic secure data science toolkit. While waiting for the merge, you can still use BastionAI under the folder bastionai.\n\n## What is this wheel?\n\nThis wheel includes the server ready to be run. You don't need to install anything else besides this wheel.\n\nThe number of settings are minimal: \n- Port number (default to 50056)\n- Session expiration time (default to 150s)\n- Keys locations (default to none)\n\nNot including keys will disable authentification, allowing you to test the server very quickly.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- Follow our [\u201cQuick Tour\u201d](docs/docs/quick-tour/quick-tour.ipynb) tutorial\n- [Read](docs/docs/concept-guides/confidential_computing.md) about the technologies we use to ensure privacy\n- Find [our benchmarks](docs/docs/reference-guides/benchmarks/polars.md) documenting BastionLab\u2019s speed\n\n## Getting Help\n- Go to our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TxEHagpWd4) #support channel\n- Report bugs by [opening an issue on our BastionLab Github](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab/issues)\n- [Book a meeting](https://calendly.com/contact-mithril-security/15mins?month=2022-11) with us\n\n## How do we organize the documentation?\n\nThe security stakes with private data are high. BastionLab uses new technologies and we want to be sure that you understand what we protect you from and what we don\u2019t protect you from.\n<br>\nHere\u2019s a high-view of how we structure our documentation:\n\n- **[Tutorials](docs/docs/quick-tour/quick-tour.ipynb)** take you by the hand to install and run BastionLab. You can get introduced to our \u201cQuick Tour\u201d first! \n- **[Concept guides](docs/docs/concept-guides/confidential_computing.md)** discuss key topics and concepts at a high level. They provide useful background information and explanations.\n- **| *Coming soon* | How-to guides** are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how BastionLab works.\n- **[Reference guides](docs/docs/reference-guides/deployment/on_premise.md)** contain technical references for BastionLab\u2019s machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume you have a good understanding of key concepts.\n\n## Who made BastionLab?\nMithril Security is a startup aiming to make privacy-friendly data science easy so data scientists and data owners can collaborate without friction. Our solutions apply Privacy Enhancing Technologies and security best practices, like [Remote Data Science]() and [Confidential Computing](docs/docs/concept-guides/confidential_computing.md).\n\n",
