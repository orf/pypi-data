If your fiscal year ends on December 31st 2020,\n3 months of expenses are part of the 2021 fiscal year and should not be part of\nthe 2020 fiscal year. So, thanks to this module, you will create a *Prepaid\nExpense* on December 31st 2020 and Odoo will identify this expense with the\n3 months that are after the cut-off date and propose to generate the\nappropriate cut-off journal entry.\n\nAnother example: you have a UPS invoice dated January 5th 2021 that covers the shipments of December 2020. When you encode this vendor bill, set the start date as December 1st 2020 and the end date as December 31st 2020. Then, thanks to this module, you will create an *Expense Accrual* dated December 31st 2020 that will generate a cut-off journal entry that will \"move\" the UPS expense from 2021 to 2020.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nPlease refer to the **CONFIGURATION** section of the README of the module *account_cutoff_base*.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo compute the prepaid revenue, go to the menu *Accounting > Cut-offs\n> Prepaid Revenue* and click on the *Create* button. Enter the cut-off\ndate, check that the source journals contains all your sale journals\nand click on the button *Re-Generate lines*: Odoo will scan all the\njournal entries of the source journals and will get all the lines that\nhave an end date after the cut-off date and, for each line, it will\ncompute the prepaid revenue. If you agree with the result, click on the\nbutton *Create Journal Entry*: Odoo will generate an account move at the\ncut-off date to cut these prepaid revenue. Hint: you can then use the reversal\nfeature to generate the reverse journal entry on the next day.\n\nIf you need to answer a question such as *How much revenue did I already\ninvoice for my next fiscal year ?*, you will be interested by the\n*forecast* feature. For that, on the Prepaid Revenue form, click on\nthe *Forecast* option and you will see 2 new fields: *Start Date* and\n*End Date*. Enter the start date and the end date of your next fiscal\nyear and click on the button *Re-Generate lines*: you will see all the\nrevenue that you already have in your source journals for that period.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-closing/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/account-closing/issues/new?body=module:%20account_cutoff_start_end_dates%0Aversion:%2015.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Akretion\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Alexis de Lattre <alexis.delattre@akretion.com>\n* St\u00e9phane Bidoul <stephane.bidoul@acsone.eu>\n* Jim Hoefnagels <jim.hoefnagels@dynapps.be>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-alexis-via| image:: https://github.com/alexis-via.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/alexis-via\n    :alt: alexis-via\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-alexis-via| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/account-closing <https://github.com/OCA/account-closing/tree/15.0/account_cutoff_start_end_dates>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
