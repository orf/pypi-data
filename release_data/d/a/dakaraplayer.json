For more help:\n\n```sh\ndakara-play -h\n# or\npython -m dakara_player -h\n```\n\nBefore calling the command, you should create a config file with:\n\n```sh\ndakara-play create-config\n# or\npython -m dakara_player create-config\n```\n\nand complete it with your values. The file is stored in your user space: `~/.config/dakara` on Linux or `$APPDATA\\Dakara` on Windows.\n\n## Customization\n\nThe different text screens used when the player is idle, or before a song, can be customized, both for the background and the text template.\nThe program looks for custom files at startup in the user directory: `~/.local/share/dakara/player` on Linux or `$APPDATA\\Dakara\\player` on Windows.\nBackgrounds are located in the `backgrounds` subfolder, and text templates in the `templates` subfolder.\nFile names can be modified in the config file, see `player.templates` and `player.backgrounds`.\n\nYou can dump the default backgrounds and templates in the user directory as a starter with:\n\n```sh\ndakara-play create-resources\n# or\npython -m dakara_player create-resources\n```\n\n## Development\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nPlease ensure you have a recent enough version of `setuptools`:\n\n```sh\npip install --upgrade \"setuptools>=40.0\"\n```\n\nInstall the dependencies with:\n\n```sh\npip install -e \".[tests]\"\n```\n\nThis installs the normal dependencies of the package plus the dependencies for tests.\n\n### Run tests\n\nRun tests simply with:\n\n```sh\npytest\n# or\npython -m pytest\n```\n\nTests are split between unit tests, which are ligthweight and do not require VLC or mpv to be installed, and integration tests, which are heavier:\n\n```sh\npytest tests/unit\npytest tests/integration\n# or\npython -m pytest tests/unit\npython -m pytest tests/integration\n```\n\nTo check coverage, use the `coverage` command:\n\n```sh\ncoverage run -m pytest\ncoverage report -m\n# or\npython -m coverage run -m pytest\npython -m coverage report -m\n```\n\n### Hooks\n\nGit hooks are included in the `hooks` directory.\n\nUse the following command to use this hook folder for the project:\n\n```\ngit config core.hooksPath hooks\n```\n\nIf you're using git < 2.9 you can make a symlink instead:\n\n```\nln -s -f ../../hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit\n```\n\nNote that pre-commit hook does not run integration tests.\n\n### Code style\n\nThe code follows the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide (88 chars per line).\nQuality of code is checked with [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/).\nStyle is enforced using [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black).\nYou need to call Black before committing changes.\nYou may want to configure your editor to call it automatically.\nAdditionnal checking can be manually performed with [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/).\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2020 Dakara Project\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
