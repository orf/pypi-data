Prior to 1.0.0 this project does not\nguarantee a stable public API.\n\n## Modules\n\n- [api](#api)\n- [crypto](#crypto)\n- [currency](#currency)\n- [onboarding](#onboarding)\n- [proto](#proto)\n- [test](#test)\n- [transactions](#transactions)\n\n### API\n\nThe API module classes provide client classes for interacting with the Helium APIs.\n\nFor full API specification and documentation please reference [docs.helium.com](https://docs.helium.com/api/blockchain).\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom helium_py.api import ChainVariables, Hotspots\n\n# Example of fetching chain variables\nchain_vars = ChainVariables()  # Create a ChainVariables client\nprint(chain_vars.get_all())    # Get all chain variables\n\n# Example of fetching hotspot earnings for the last five days\nhotspot_address = \"some_valid_hotspot_address\"\nhotspots = Hotspots()\nhotspots.get_hotspot_rewards_total(hotspot_address, min_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=5))\n```\n\n### Crypto\n\nThe Crypto module classes provide Address, Keypair, and Mnemonic classes as well as helpful utilities.\n\n```python\nfrom helium_py.crypto.keypair import Keypair\n\n# Example of creating a random keypair, accessing the address, and signing a message\nkeypair = Keypair.make_random()\naddress = keypair.address.b58  # B58 public key address\nkeypair.sign(b'message')  # Sign a message with keypair private key\n```\n",
