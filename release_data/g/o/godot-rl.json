No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. \n\nYou can find out more about Godot RL agents in our AAAI-2022 Workshop [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03636).\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7275864/140730165-dbfddb61-cc90-47c7-86b3-88086d376641.mp4\n\n## Contents\n<!-- no toc -->\n1.

Customizable enemies, worlds and story telling will lead to diverse gameplay experiences and new genres of games. Currently the field is dominated by large organizations and pay to use engines that have the budget to create such AI enhanced agents. The objective of the Godot RL Agents package is to lower the bar of accessability so that game developers can take their idea from creation to publication end-to-end with an open source and free package.\n### Citing Godot RL Agents\n```\n@article{beeching2021godotrlagents,\n  author={Beeching, Edward and Dibangoye, Jilles and \n    Simonin, Olivier and Wolf, Christian},\ntitle = {Godot Reinforcement Learning Agents},\njournal = {{arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.03636.},\nyear = {2021}, \n}\n\n\n```\n### Installation\nPlease follow the [installation instructions](docs/INSTALLATION.md) to install Godot RL agents.\n### Examples\nWe provide several reference implementations and instructions to implement your own environment, please refer to the [Examples](docs/EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENTS.md) documentation.\n### Creating custom environments\nOnce you have studied the example environments, you can follow the instructions in [Custom environments](docs/CUSTOM_ENV.md) in order to make your own. \n### Roadmap\nWe have number features that will soon be available in versions 0.2.0 and 0.3.0. \nRefer to the [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for more information.\n\n\n### FAQ\n1. Why have we developed Godot RL Agents?\n  The objectives of the framework are to:\n* Provide a free and open source tool for Deep RL research and game development.\n* Enable game creators to imbue their non-player characters with unique * behaviors.\n* Allow for automated gameplay testing through interaction with an RL agent.\n1. How can I contribute to Godot RL Agents?\n   Please try it out, find bugs and either raise an issue or if you fix them yourself, submit a pull request.\n2. When will you be providing Mac support?\n   I would like to provide this ASAP but I do not own a mac so I cannot perform any manual testing of the codebase.\n3. Can you help with my game project? \n   If the game example do not provide enough information, reach out to us on github and we may be able to provide some advice.\n4. How similar is this tool to Unity ML agents?\n   We are inspired by the the Unity ML agents toolkit and make no effort to hide it.\n\n### Licence\nGodot RL Agents is MIT licensed.
