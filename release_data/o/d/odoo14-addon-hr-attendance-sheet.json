Go to *Attendances -> Configuration*.\n#. Set the Attendance Sheet Range to be used to calculate start/end dates\non the sheet when they are created.\n#. Set the Attendance Sheet Review Policy for who can review sheets.\n#. Choose Auto Lunch if you want a lunch calculated automatically. Duration is\nmaximum hours where a lunch would be calculated with the lunch duration.\nFor example, duration set to 5hrs, lunch set to .5hrs, if attendance is 6hours\nthen the duration on the attendance would show 5.5hrs due to the auto lunch.\nNote: if there is two attendances and there is enough time between them, then\nauto lunch won't be applied.\n\nEmployee Configuration:\n#. Go to *Attendances -> Manage Attendances -> Employees*.\n#. Open the Employee and then HR Settings\n#. Check Manual Attendance to give them access to the attendance app.\n#. Check Attendance Sheets if they will be having sheets created for them.\n#. Set Hours to Work which is the expected work time during the sheet period,\nthis is used to calculates overtime values on the sheet.\n#. If manager's are set to review, make sure a manager is set on the employee.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n#. Sheets will be auto created by a scheduled action for employees that have\nthe attendance sheet checked on their employee record.\n#. Sheets will have a start/end time based on the period set in settings.\n#. Attendances that have dates between the sheet start/end time will\nautomatically be put into the sheet.\n#. Auto lunch (if enabled) will be calculated in the attendance duration if the\nduration exceeds the auto lunch setting. A banner will show on the attendance\nstating that an auto lunch has been applied.\n#. After sheet period ends, Employee submits sheet to reviewer. Reviewer makes\nchanges if necessary and approves sheet.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/issues/new?body=module:%20hr_attendance_sheet%0Aversion:%2014.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Odoo S.A.\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Patrick Wilson <pwilson@pavlovmedia.com>\n* Freni Patel <fpatel@opensourceintegrators.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-patrickrwilson| image:: https://github.com/patrickrwilson.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/patrickrwilson\n    :alt: patrickrwilson\n.. |maintainer-max3903| image:: https://github.com/max3903.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/max3903\n    :alt: max3903\n\nCurrent `maintainers <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-patrickrwilson| |maintainer-max3903| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/hr-attendance <https://github.com/OCA/hr-attendance/tree/14.0/hr_attendance_sheet>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
