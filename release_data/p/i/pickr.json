My name is: $name. My favourite fruit is: $fruit\"\n    echo: false\n    args:\n      - name\n      - fruit: apple\n```\n\nWhich adds the command group `test` wth a single command called `my-command`. When `my-command` is selected to be run, _peaks_ prompts the user for `name` and `fruit` before running the command specified in `cmd`, where `fruit` is defaulted to `apple` if the user does not give any input.\n\nFor more details, see the [configuration](https://fpgmaas.github.io/peaks/configuration) section of the documentation.\n\n---\n\nRepository initiated with [fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry](https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry).\n",
