The following features make \n`foamgraph` stand out:\n\n- The widgets and graphics objects are dedicated for photon science experiments.\n- The performance has been significantly improved.\n- It trades flexibility for an easy-to-use and unified API.\n\nIt must be emphasized that `foamgraph` is only a GUI library. It does not provide\nany interfaces for data and metadata exchange between the backend and the GUI because\nit is facility and experiment specific.\n\nNevertheless, when integrating GUI into a real-time data analysis pipeline, \nthere are a couple of things to be taken into account:\n- The GUI in principle should not perform any number crunching jobs, otherwise it \nwill be slowed down because it is written in Python.\n- Light computation tasks can be performed in a Python thread and the communication \nbetween the GUI and the processor can still be fulfilled using Qt's signal-slot connections.\n\n## Getting started\n\nEvery plot widget should inherit from `PlotWidgetF`. The following code snippet\nshows how to create a double-y plot with a title, axis labels and a legend:\n\n```py\nfrom foamgraph import FColor, PlotWidgetF\n\n\nclass DoubleYPlot(PlotWidgetF):\n    def __init__(self, *, parent=None):\n        super().__init__(parent=parent)\n\n        self.setTitle('Double-y plot')\n        self.setXYLabels(\"x (arb. u.)\", \"y (arb. u.)\", y2=\"y2 (arg. u.)\")\n\n        self._plot = self.plotCurve(label=\"Data\", pen=FColor.mkPen('w'))\n        self._plot2 = self.plotBar(\n            label=\"Count\", y2=True, brush=FColor.mkBrush('i', alpha=150))\n        self.addLegend()\n\n    def updateF(self, data):\n        \"\"\"Override.\"\"\"\n        self._plot.setData(data['x'], data['y'])\n        self._plot2.setData(data['x'], data['y2'])\n```\n\nEvery widget for image analysis should inherit from `ImageViewF`. The following\ncode snippet shows how to create a simple widget for displaying an image:\n\n```py\nfrom foamgraph import ImageViewF\n\n\nclass ImageAnalysis(ImageViewF):\n    def updateF(self, data):\n        \"\"\"Override.\"\"\"\n        self.setImage(data['image']['data'])\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n* Open a terminal and start the producer:\n\n```sh\npython examples/producer.py\n```\n\n* Open another terminal and start the plot gallery example\n\n```sh\npython examples/plot_gallery.py\n```\n\n![](examples/plot_gallery.gif)\n\n* Open another terminal and start the image analysis example\n\n```sh\npython examples/image_analysis.py\n```\n\n![](examples/image_analysis.gif)\n",
