Follow us [on github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/balance)!\n\n## What is *balance*?\n\n**[*balance*](https://import-balance.org/) is a Python package** offering a simple workflow and methods for **dealing with biased data samples** when looking to infer from them to some population of interest.\n\nBiased samples often occur in [survey statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_methodology) when respondents present [non-response bias or survey suffers from sampling bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias) (that are not [missing completely at random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data#Missing_completely_at_random)). A similar issue arises in [observational studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study) when comparing the treated vs untreated groups, and in any data that suffers from selection bias.\n\nUnder the missing at random assumption ([MAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data#Missing_at_random)), bias in samples could sometimes be (at least partially) mitigated by relying on auxiliary information (a.k.a.: \u201ccovariates\u201d or \u201cfeatures\u201d) that is present for all items in the sample, as well as present in a sample of items from the population. For example, if we want to infer from a sample of respondents to some survey, we may wish to adjust for non-response using demographic information such as age, gender, education, etc. This can be done by weighing the sample to the population using auxiliary information.\n\nThe package is intended for researchers who are interested in balancing biased samples, such as the ones coming from surveys, using a Python package. This need may arise by survey methodologists, demographers, UX researchers, market researchers, and generally data scientists, statisticiains, and machine learners.\n\n\n# Installation\n\n## Requirements\nYou need Python 3.8 or later to run *balance*. *balance* can be built and run\nfrom OSX, Linux, and Windows\n\nThe required Python dependencies are:\n```python\nREQUIRES = [\n    \"numpy\",\n    \"pandas<=1.4.3\",\n    \"ipython\",\n    \"scipy<=1.8.1\",\n    \"patsy\",\n    \"seaborn<=0.11.1\",\n    \"plotly\",\n    \"matplotlib\",\n    \"statsmodels\",\n    \"scikit-learn\",\n    \"ipfn\",\n]\n```\n\nNote that glmnet_python must be installed from the [Github source](https://github.com/bbalasub1/glmnet_python.git@1.0)\n\nSee [setup.py](https://github.com/facebookresearch/balance/blob/main/setup.py) for more details.\n\n## Installing *balance*\nAs a prerequisite, you must install glmnet_python from source:\n```\npython -m pip install git+https://github.com/bbalasub1/glmnet_python.git@1.0\n```\n\n### Installing via PyPi\nWe recommend installing *balance* from PyPi via pip for the latest stable version:\n\n```\npython -m pip install balance\n```\n\nInstallation will use Python wheels from PyPI, available for [OSX, Linux, and Windows](https://pypi.org/project/balance/#files).\n\n### Installing from Source/Git\n\nYou can install the latest (bleeding edge) version from Git:\n\n```\npython -m pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/balance.git\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you have a local clone of the repo:\n\n```\ncd balance\npython -m pip install .\n```\n\n\n# Getting started\n\n## balance\u2019s workflow in high-level\n\nThe core workflow in [*balance*](https://import-balance.org/) deals with fitting and evaluating weights to a sample. For each unit in the sample (such as a respondent to a survey), balance fits a weight that can be (loosely) interpreted as the number of people from the target population that this respondent represents. This aims to help mitigate the coverage and non-response biases, as illustrated in the following figure.\n\n![total_survey_error_img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebookresearch/balance/main/website/docs/docs/img/total_survey_error_image.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAB25KSTWSBZGTWAJ7LJ3U3G6Y3VG4XA)\n\n\nThe weighting of survey data through *balance* is done in the following main steps:\n\n1. Loading data of the respondents of the survey.\n2. Loading data about the target population we would like to correct for.\n3. Diagnostics of the sample covariates so to evaluate whether weighting is needed.\n4. Adjusting the sample to the target.\n5. Evaluation of the results.\n6. Use the weights for producing population level estimations.\n7. Saving the output weights.\n\nYou can see a step-by-step description (with code) of the above steps in the [General Framework](https://import-balance.org/docs/docs/general_framework/) page.\n\n## Code example of using *balance*\n\nYou may run the following code to play with *balance*'s basic workflow (these are snippets taken from the [quickstart tutorial](https://import-balance.org/docs/tutorials/quickstart/)):\n\nWe start by loading data, and adjusting it:\n\n```python\nfrom balance import load_data, Sample\n\n# load simulated example data\ntarget_df, sample_df = load_data()\n\n# Import dample and target data into a Sample object\nsample = Sample.from_frame(sample_df, outcome_columns=[\"happiness\"])\ntarget = Sample.from_frame(target_df)\n\n# Set the target to be the target of sample\nsample_with_target = sample.set_target(target)\n\n# Check basic diagnostics of sample vs target before adjusting:\n# sample_with_target.covars().plot()\n\n```\n\n*You can read more on evaluation of the pre-adjusted data in the [Pre-Adjustment Diagnostics](https://import-balance.org/docs/docs/general_framework/pre_adjustment_diagnostics/) page.*\n\nNext, we adjust the sample to the population by fitting balancing survey weights:\n\n```python\n# Using ipw to fit survey weights\nadjusted = sample_with_target.adjust(max_de=None)\n```\n\n*You can read more on adjustment process in the [Adjusting Sample to Population](https://import-balance.org/docs/docs/general_framework/adjusting_sample_to_population/) page.*\n\nThe above code gets us an `adjusted` object with weights. We can evaluate the benefit of the weights to the coveriate balance, for example by running:\n\n```python\nprint(adjusted.summary())\n    # Covar ASMD reduction: 62.3%, design effect: 2.249\n    # Covar ASMD (7 variables):0.335 -> 0.126\n    # Model performance: Model proportion deviance explained: 0.174\n\nadjusted.covars().plot(library = \"seaborn\", dist_type = \"kde\")\n```\n\nAnd get:\n\n![](https://import-balance.org/assets/images/fig_07_seaborn_after-ac7514f6b150f431b36329bb9ebd9d0a.png)\n\nWe can also check the impact of the weights on the outcome using:\n\n```python\n# For the outcome:\nprint(adjusted.outcomes().summary())\n    # 1 outcomes: ['happiness']\n    # Mean outcomes:\n    #             happiness\n    # source\n    # self        54.221388\n    # unadjusted  48.392784\n    #\n    # Response rates (relative to number of respondents in sample):\n    #    happiness\n    # n     1000.0\n    # %      100.0\nadjusted.outcomes().plot()\n```\n![](https://import-balance.org/assets/images/fig_09_seaborn_outcome_kde_after-26fa9668164349253b2614335961ade9.png)\n\n*You can read more on evaluation of the post-adjusted data in the [Evaluating and using the adjustment weights](https://import-balance.org/docs/docs/general_framework/evaluation_of_results/) page.*\n\n\nFinally, the adjusted data can be downloded using:\n```python\nadjusted.to_download()  # Or:\n# adjusted.to_csv()\n```\n\nTo see a more detailed step-by-step code example with code output prints and plots (both static and interactive), please go over to the [quickstart tutorial](https://import-balance.org/docs/tutorials/quickstart/).\n\n\n## Implemented methods for adjustments\n\n*balance* currently implements various adjustment methods.

Main summaries (mean, median, variances, quantiles)\n    2. Covariate distributions\n        1. Absolute Standardized Mean Difference (ASMD). For continuous variables, it is [Cohen's d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d). Categorical variables are one-hot encoded, Cohen's d is calculated for each category and ASMD for a categorical variable is defined as Cohen's d, average across all categories.\n\n*You can read more on evaluation of the post-adjusted data in the [Evaluating and using the adjustment weights](https://import-balance.org/docs/docs/general_framework/evaluation_of_results/) page.*\n\n# More details\n\n## Getting help, submitting bug reports and contributing code\n\nYou are welcome to:\n\n* Learn more in the [*balance*](https://import-balance.org/) website.\n* Ask for help on: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/balance\n* Submit bug-reports and features' suggestions at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/balance/issues\n* Send a pull request on: https://github.com/facebookresearch/balance.
