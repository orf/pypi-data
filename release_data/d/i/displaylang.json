It was originally designed for authoring\nexample explorers in Proofscape, but it attempts to solve a fairly general\nproblem, so should be more broadly useful.\n\nIn fact the set of `AllowedCallable`s for SymPy functions and classes which\ncan be used in Proofscape is defined in the\n[pfsc-examp](https://github.com/proofscape/pfsc-examp) project, not here.\nThis project is more foundational, defining AST node traversers, providing\nthe basic framework for defining `AllowedCallable`s, and defining these for\nbuilt-in Python functions and methods.\n\n## The language\n\nThe syntax is defined by three things:\n\n* Which statement and expression types in the Python language we support.\n* Which callables we allow to be called.\n* For the allowed callables, what types the arguments are allowed to be, and,\n  when they are strings, what regexes the strings must match.\n\nThe reason for paying special attention to string arguments is that there are\nfunctions that are definitely unsafe if they can be passed arbitrary\nstrings, but are probably safe as long as either we don't allow strings to be\npassed at all, or we allow only strings of certain restricted forms.\n\nOf course we need to be careful about built-in Python callables, such\nas `exec` and `eval`, not to mention things like `os.system`. So our overall\nsolution is to ban all function calls outside a finite, curated, set of\napproved calls. The set is expected to grow over time, in response to user\ndemand.\n\nAmong banned statement types are `import` statements, which supports the\nproviding of only a finite, curated set of available _names_.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBetter docs are on the way, but for now we offer the following hints for\ngetting started:\n\n* See the `displaylang.build.DisplayLangProcessor.process()` method, for the\n  core code that processes a string of DisplayLang.\n  - See also the `displaylang.build.make_displaylang_processor()` convenience\n    function for building a `DisplayLangProcessor` instance.\n\n* Check out the `displaylang.allow.AllowedCallable.__init__()` method to see\n  how an `AllowedCallable` is defined.\n\n\n",
