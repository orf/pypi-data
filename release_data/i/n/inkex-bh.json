The sample course map on the official [BHA Judging Assignment\nCheat Sheet][cheat] is one of mine. (The previous versions of the\nplugins worked with Inkscape version 0.x.  The plugin API has changed\nconsiderably since then, so a rewrite was necessary to get the plugins\nto work with more modern versions of Inkscape.)\n\nThese extensions are, as yet, poorly documented, and likely not to\nwork without tweaks in all environments (I used Linux \u2014 these\nextensions are totally untested on Windows), so I'm not sure that\nthey're generally useful, yet.\n\nThe goal is for these to work on all version of Inkscape with versions\nof 1.0 or greater.  Currently, these have be cursorily tested under\nInkscape versions 1.1.2 and 1.2.1.\n\n[Inkscape]: https://inkscape.org/ (The Inkscape home page)\n[Barn Hunt]: https://www.barnhunt.com/ (Barn Hunt \u2014 a fabulous sport for dogs)\n[cheat]: https://www.barnhunt.com/judge/resources.php?download=147 (The official BHA \"Judging Assignment Cheat Sheet\" which includes, as an example, one of my course maps, drawn using Inkscape.)\n\n\n## What\u2019s Here?\n\nCurrently there are four extensions.\n\n### Count Symbols\n\nWe use Inkscape symbol libraries containing map elements like\nindividual bales, rat tube markers, etc to draw our maps.  This plugin\nsimply counts what symbols are visible, and reports a list of symbol\nnames along with how many times they are used in the drawing.  (By\ndefault, only symbols on visible layers are counted.)\n\n![Example output from the \"Count Symbols\" extension](https://github.com/barnhunt/inkex-bh/raw/master/count-symbols.png)\n\n#### The bh:count-as symbol attribute\n\nSymbols may be marked with a custom `bh:count-as` attribute, in order\nto have them counted under some name other than their XML `id`.\n\nI have a number of different symbols for bales: first level bales,\nsecond level bales, bales on edge, leaners, etc.  I would like all\nbales of a given size counted under the same name.  So, in my symbol\nlibraries, I set a `bh:count-as=\"bale-42x18x16\"` on each of the\nvariants of 42\u201dx18\u201dx16\u201d bales.\n\n### Create Inset\n\nThis extension creates an embedded PNG image created by exporting a\nportion of the drawing.  Such images are useful, for example, to include\na base-layer map (possibly at reduced scale) on the same page as the complete\ncourse map.\n\nTo use, one should:\n\n1. Hide/unhide layers as you wish, to make what you want visible in\n   the exported image visible.\n\n2. Select one object in the drawing. That object will define the\n   rectangular bounding box of the exported image.  Then run the\n   extension.\n\nThis will create an image. It will be created on top of all other\nlayers in the drawing. (You will probably want to move that image into\nan appropriate layer.)\n\n#### Regenerating the Insets\n\nThe layers that were visible when the image was generated, and the\nobject which defined the boundary of the image are recorded in custom\nattributes on the `<svg:image>` element.  This makes it easy to\nregenerate the image(s), should that become necessary (e.g. after\nyou've made changes to the drawing.)\n\nSimply select just the generated images you'd like regenerated, and\nfire off the extension.  It will adjust layer visibility to match what\nit was when each image was first exported, and re-export it.\n\n\n### Hide Rats\n\nThe third extension is used to randomize the position of rat tubes on rat maps.\n\nInstructions pending... :-/\n\n### Set Random Seed\n\nThis sets or updates a random number stored in a custom attribute out\nthe `<svg>` element of the drawing.  This number is used by the\n[barnhunt][] program to seed the pseudo-random number generator used\nwhen expanding text templates.  Setting it to a unique number ensure,\ne.g., that the Master random rat numbers come out random, but still\nreproducible.\n\nWhen one copies an existing `.svg` file to use a template for a new\ntrial, one should run this plugin, with the _force-reseed_ checkbox\nchecked, to ensure that the copied file gets a new, unique random\nseed.\n\n----\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install a released version of this package:\n\n1. Download the packaged zip file _asset_ from the GitHub [Releases\n   page](https://github.com/barnhunt/inkex-bh/releases) for the\n   desired release.  (Those are the zip files named something like\n   `inkex_bh-`_version_`.zip`.)\n\n2. Unzip the zip file into your Inkscape user extensions directory.\n\n   On Linux this can be done thusly:\n   ```bash\n   # remove previous installed version, if any\n   rm -r \"$(inkscape --user-data-directory)/extensions/org.dairiki.inkex_bh\"\n\n   # unpack desired version of extensions to user's Inkscape extensions directory\n   unzip -d \"$(inkscape --user-data-directory)/extensions\" inkex_bh-X.Y.Z.zip\n   ```\n\n> **Warning**: It is no longer recommended to install the extensions\n  using `pip`.  (Though, for now, the package will continue to be\n  published to PyPI.)\n\n### Packaging\n\nTo build a packaged zip file from the git source, clone the git\nrepository, install [hatch], then run\n\n```bash\nhatch build --target zipped-directory\n```\n\nThat should build a zip archive in the `dist/` subdirectory.\n\n[hatch]: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/\n\n----\n\n\n## What's Elsewhere?\n\nThere are two other bits I use when drawing maps.\n\nNeither of these are published in a public place, yet.\n\nAnd, of course, their use is not documented at all.\n\nKick me if you want to know more.\n\n\n### Barn Hunt Symbol Libraries for Inkscape\n\nI've constructed some symbol libraries for Inkscape containing things\nlike bales, boards, rat markers, fluff pile symbols, etc.\n\nI've even got a semi-automatic scheme set up by which I can generate\nsymbol sets for arbitrary sized bales.\n\n\n### The `barnhunt` command-line export utility\n\nI draw all my maps for a given course (for a day or weekend) on\nvarious nested layers in a single drawing.  By hiding and unhiding\nvarious sets of layers all of my maps can be generated.\n\nI have a python script named [`barnhunt`][barnhunt], whose primary job\nis to automate that layer hiding/unhiding and PDF exporting process.\nWhile exporting the map, it can also expand special template syntax in\ntext in the drawings.  This can be used to automate the printing of\ncourse names and blind numbers on the exported map, and is also used\nto generate the random Master rat numbers.\n\nSadly, at present there is zero documentation on how to use it.\n\nKick me if you want to know more.\n\n[barnhunt]: https://github.com/barnhunt/barnhunt\n\n## Author\n\nJeff Dairiki, BHAJ-221A\n<dairiki@dairiki.org>\n\n----\n\n## Changes\n\n### 1.0.0rc3 (2022-10-12)\n\n#### Bugs\n\n- Fix the _create inset_ and _hide rats_ extensions so that they might\n  actually run under Inkscape 1.0.x.\n\n#### Packaging\n\n- We now build and publish \u2014 as GitHub Release artifacts \u2014 zip\n  archives of the extension that suitable for unzipping in a user's\n  Inkscape extensions directory.\n\n- Use [hatch] for packaging.\n\n- Remove runtime dependency on `typing_extensions`.\n\n#### Testing\n\n- Install `inkex` from custom-built wheels in the python registry at\n  https://gitlab.com/dairiki/inkex/.  The versions of `inkex` on PyPI\n  are stale, and also don't match the `inkex` included in any\n  particular version of Inkscape.\n\n- We now test (I think) under truly the whole matrix of supported\n  python \u00d7 Inkscape/inkex versions.\n\n\n[hatch]: https://github.com/pypa/hatch\n\n### 1.0.0rc2 (2022-09-25)\n\n#### Bugs Fixed\n\n##### Hide Rats\n\n- When _Clone rat layer_ selected, cloning of text was screwed up.\n\n### 1.0.0rc1 (2022-08-31)\n\nThis is a fairly complete rewrite and repackaging of a set of Barn\nHunt extensions I used with Inkscape 0.9x.  (As of Inkscape 1.0, the\nextension API changed significantly, so this required a significant\nrework.)\n",
