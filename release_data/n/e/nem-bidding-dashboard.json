Hit \"*Use this template*\" in the top right of this page\n2. Work through as much of the [basic](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/ceem-python-template#basic), [intermediate](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/ceem-python-template#intermediate) and [advanced](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/ceem-python-template#advanced) steps as you like.\n3. Edit this README and make sure you update `your_package`, `your_name` and `licence_type`.\n\n### References\n\nNothing helps as much as examples.\n- [This](https://www.marwandebbiche.com/posts/python-package-tooling/) is a great guide that provides a brief overview of all the tools we use in this template.\n- All of the tooling has been implemented in [`nemseer`](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMSEER)\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic\n\n#### Updating repo info\n\n1. [Choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/), and add the `LICENSE` file to the repo\n2. Update your [code of conduct](CONDUCT.md)\n3. Update the [*Get Started!* section](CONTRIBUTING.md#get-started) of the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n    - Note that this currently has steps you would use to install poetry v1.2.0 and various dependency groups that are being used by [`nemseer`](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMSEER)\n4. (Optional) [Make your software citeable](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)\n\n#### Poetry\n\nPoetry is used for dependency management, dependency resolution and can also be used as a build tool.\n\n1. Install [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/)\n    - Note that this repo is using poetry v1.2.0, so install this version (see the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#get-started))\n    - As of August 2022, 1.2.0 is still pre-release, so make sure you are on the `master` version of the poetry documentation\n    - Edit the project info in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml), or delete it and use `poetry init` to start from scratch (if you are proceeding to the next few sections, it is best not to delete the existig `pyproject.toml`)\n    - You can add dependencies in the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) or use the command line:\n      - You can add a core dependency via `poetry add`, e.g. `poetry add pandas`\n      - You can add dependencies to a group (adding to a group is optional) using `poetry add pytest --group test`\n      - You can install the dependencies from `poetry.lock`, including optional groups, using `poetry install --with=test`\n      - You can update dependencies and create a `poetry.lock` file using `poetry update`\n    - Run scripts with `poetry run`, or jsut spawn a shell in the poetry virtual environment using `poetry shell` and then run your code\n    - **Commit `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` to version control**\n\n#### Testing\n\n1. To install testing dependencies, use `poetry install --with=test`\n2. Put your tests in `tests/`\n3. Run your tests by running `pytest` in the project directory\n4. Test coverage will be in `tests/htmlcov/index.html`\n\n### Intermediate\n\n#### Linters, Auto-formatting and `pre-commit`\n\nBecause code shouldn't look awful. We will be using `isort` (import sorting), `flake8` (python linter) and `black` (an autoformatter) via [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/).\n\n`pre-commit` streamlines creating [pre-commit hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks), which are run prior to a commit being accepted by git (locally). This way, your code won't be committed if there are style issues (some of which will be automatically addressed by `black` or `isort`, after which you must stage any further changes).\n\n1. Install the style packages using `poetry install --with=style`\n2. (Optional) Configure any additional pre-commit hooks in the [YAML](.pre-commit-config.yaml)\n3. Run `pre-commit install` to install the hooks\n4. To run manually, you can run `pre-commit run -a`. Alternatively, these hooks will run as you try and commit changes\n5. (Optional) Install `black` extensions that auto-format on save in your favourite IDE\n\n#### Automated testing and publishing to PyPI\n\nBoth of these can be achieved via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).\n\nNote that some testing config is specified in the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).\n\n1. The workflow is located [here](.github/workflows/cicd.yml). It is commented to give you an understanding of what it does\n    1. Automatically runs linting and autoformatting as above\n    2. If that passes, then runs your code tests across Mac and Ubuntu for a couple of Python versions\n    3. If a [GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) is created based on a Git tag, it will build the package and upload to PyPI\n        - To get this to work, you will need to add your PyPI username and password as [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)\n2. Uncomment the lines specified. This should allow the workflow to run on a push, pull-request or when manually triggered. Note that publishing to PyPI is only triggered on a release\n3. Activate the workflow. Do this by navigating to the Actions tab, selecting `...` and activating it.\n\n### Advanced\n\nIf you've made it this far, well done. Prepare for the most tricky bit: documentation\n\nThis section is a WIP. We will add to it as we come across good resources.\n\n#### Documentation\n\nDocumentation is located in the docs folder.\n\nThis project uses:\n\n1. [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) to generate documentation. Sphinx is based on reStructuredText.\n    - We use several Sphinx extensions that make using Sphinx easier\n      - [`autodoc`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) which will help you automatically generate the documentation from the docstrings in your code\n      - [`napoleon`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) which lets you write docstrings in your code using NumPy or Google style docstrings (as opposed to reStructuredText)\n    - Sphinx is configured in [`conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py)\n2. [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html), a parser which optionally lets you write your documentation using Markdown. If you know Markdown, this can reduce, but not eliminate, the need for reStructuredText.\n3. [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) to host our documentation online. You'll need to link RtD to your repo (see [here](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/)). Settings can be configured in the [YAML](.readthedocs.yaml)\n\n##### Gotcha: clearing your browser cache\n\nIf you make changes to your docs, successfully build it locally (see below) or on RtD and then see that no change has been made, your browser may be caching the old version of the docs. Clear your browser cache and then try again.\n\n##### Building locally\n\nFirst, install the packages required for buildings docs using `poetry install --with=docs`\n\nYou can test whether your documentation builds locally by using the commands offered by the [Makefile](./docs/Makefile). To do this, change directory to `docs` and run `make` to see build options. The easiest option is `make html`.\n\n##### Sphinx tutorials\n\nThere is a fair bit to learn to be able to write docs. Even if you use MyST, you will need to learn about [roles and directives](https://sphinx-intro-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx_roles.html).\n\nHere are some tutorials:\n- [A tutorial prepared for PyCon 2021](https://sphinx-intro-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n- [The official Sphinx tutorial](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/index.html)\n\n##### Examples\n\nThe source folder in this template repo contains basics for making docs. There is also an example of the markdown file used to generate the [API section of the `nemseer` docs](docs/source/nemseer_example.md).\n\n You can also refer to:\n  - [nempy's docs](https://nempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n  - [nemseer's docs](https://nemseer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n#### Tool Config\n\n- `flake8` is configured by [.flake8](.flake8)\n- `pytest`, `isort` and `mypy` (not included) can be configured in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)\n- See relevant sections above for config for `pre-commit`, `read-the-docs` and Sphinx\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing?
