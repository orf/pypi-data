This\ncombination provides a tool that is extensible, powerful and freely\navailable.  A significant advantage to Python is the existing suite of\ntools for array calculations, sparse matrices and data rendering.\n\nThe FiPy framework includes terms for transient diffusion, convection and\nstandard sources, enabling the solution of arbitrary combinations of\ncoupled elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs.  Currently implemented\nmodels include phase field treatments of polycrystalline, dendritic, and\nelectrochemical phase transformations, as well as drug eluting stents,\nreactive wetting, photovoltaics and a level set treatment of the\nelectrodeposition process.\n",
