Then you can interact with it with the `GamaClient` class.\nCurrently the available operations are:\n * connecting to gama-server\n * check if the connection is still alive\n * load an experiment on the server (compile + run the `init` block)\n * run an experiment\n * pause an experiment\n * execute one step of the experiment\n * rollback one step of the experiment (when available)\n * reload an experiment\n * stop an experiment\n * ask gama-server to process a gaml expression (having an experiment as context)\n \n A complete working example is given in the `examples` directory, you just have to change the values of the variables `MY_SERVER_URL`, `MY_SERVER_PORT`, `GAML_FILE_PATH_ON_SERVER` and `EXPERIMENT_NAME` to the one corresponding to your own gama-server and experiment to try it.\n \n \n",
