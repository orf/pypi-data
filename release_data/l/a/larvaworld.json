            "description": "==================LARVAWORLD==================\n\nDrosophila larva behavioral analysis and simulation platform\n\n================================================\n\nPublication :\n\nA realistic locomotory model of Drosophila larva for behavioral simulations\n\nPanagiotis Sakagiannis, Anna-Maria J\u00fcrgensen, Martin Paul Nawrot\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.451470 \n\nGUI\n===================\nA user-friendly GUI allows easy importation, inspection and analysis of data, model, life-history and environment configuration, visualization and data-acquisition setup and control over simulations, essays and batch-runs. Videos and tutorials are also available. In principal the user shouldn't have to mess with the code at all.\n\nVisualization\n===================\nBoth imported experiments and simulations can be visualized real-time at realistic scale. The pop-up screen allows zooming in and out, locking on specific individuals, bringing up dynamic graphs of selected parameters, coloring of the midline, contour, head and centroid, linear and angular velocity dependent coloring of the larva trajectories and much more. Keyboard and mouse shortcuts enable changing parameters online, adding or deleting agents, food and odor sources and impassable borders.\n\nArena drawing\n===================\nThe GUI features an arena editor that supports :\n\n   1. Arenas and dishes\n      The arena editor allows defining arena shape and dimensions in detail and placement of larva groups and items at prefered locations in predefined spatial         distributions and orientations.\n   2.Odorcapes\n      Odor sources can be specified and arbitrary odor landscapes can be constructed. The constructed arenas are directly available for modeling simulations. The       virtual larvae themselves can bear an odor creating dynamic odorscapes while moving.\n   3. Food items\n      Food sources are availble either as single items, distributions of defined parameters or food grids of defined dimensions. \n   4. Impassable borders.\n\n\n\nLarva models\n=====================\nMultiple aspects of real larvae are captured in various models. These can be configured through the GUI at maximum detail and directly tested in simulations.  Specifically the components are:\n\n\n   1. Virtual body\n            The 2D body consists of 1, 2(default) or more segments, featuring viscoelastic forces (torsional spring model), olfactory and touch sensors at                     desired locations and a mouth for feeding. Exemplary models with angular and linear motion optimized to fit empirical data are available                           featuring differential motion of the front and rear segments and realistic velocities and accelerations at both plains. Furthermore optional use                   of the Box2D physics engine is available as illustrated in an example of realistic imitation of real larvae with a multi-segment body model.\n   2. Sensorimotor effectors\n            Crawling, lateral bending and feeding are modeled as oscillatory processes, either independent, coupled or mutually exclusive. The individual                     modules and their interaction are easily configurable through the GUI. Body-dependent phasic interference can be defined as well. An olfactory                     sensor dynamically tracks odor gradients enabling chemotactic navigation. Feedback from the environment is only partially supported as in the case                 of reoccurent feeding motion at succesfull food encounter.\n   3. Intermittent behavior\n            Intermittent function of the oscillator modules is available through definition of specific spatial or temporal distributions. Models featuring                   empirically-fitted intermittent crawling interspersed by brief pauses can be readily tested. Time has been quantized at the scale of single                       crawling or feeding motions.\n   4. Olfactory learning\n            A neuron-level detailed mushroom-body model has been integrated to the locomotory model, enabling olfactory learning after associative                             conditioning of novel odorants to food. The short neuron-level temporal scale (0.1 ms) has been coupled to the 0.1 s behavioral timestep in parallel               simulation. Detailed implementations of an established olfactory learning behavioral paradigm are supported.\n   5. Energetics and life-history\n            A widely-accepted dynamic energy budget (DEB) model runs in the background and controls energy allocation to growth and biomass maintenance. The model             has been fitted to Drosophila and accurately reproduces the larva life stage in terms of body-length, wet-weight, instar duration and time to                     pupation. The long timescale model (in days) has been coupled to the behavioral timescale as well. Therefore virtual larvae can be realistically                   reared in substrates of specified quality before entering the behavioral simulation or can be starved for defined periods during or before being                   tested.\n   6. Hunger drive and foraging phenotypes\n            The DEB energetics module has been coupled to behavior via a variety of model configurations, each based on different assumptions. For example in one             implementation a hunger/satiety homeostatic drive that tracks the enrgy reserve density deriving from metabolism controls the exploration VS                       exploitation behavioral balance, boosting consumption after food deprivation and vice versa. The rover and sitter foraging phenotypes have been                   modeled, integrating differential glucose absorption to differential exploration pathlength and food consumption. \n\n\n\nData import & Behavioral analysis\n========================================\nExperimental datasets from a variety of tracker software can be imported and transformed to a common hdf5 format so that they can be analysed and directly compared to the simulated data. To make datasets compatible and facilitate reproducibility, only the primary tracked x,y coordinates are used, both of the midline points and optionally points around the body contour.Compatible formats are text files, either per individual or per group. All secondary parameters are derived via an identical pipeline that allows parameterization and definition of novel metrics. \n\n\n\nBehavioral simulation\n=====================\nThe simulation platform supports simulations of experiments that implement established behavioral paradigms reported in literature. These can be run as single simulations, grouped in essays for globally testing models over multiple conditions and arenas or as batch-runs that allow parameter search and optimization of defined utility metrics. Specifically the behaviors covered are :\n\n   1. Free exploration\n   2. Chemotaxis\n   3. Olfactory learning an odor preference\n   4. Feeding\n   5. Foraging in patch environments\n   6. Growth over the whole larva stage\n\nFinally some games are availble for fun where opposite larva groups try to capture the flag or stay at the top of the odorscape hill!!!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSupporting resources\n=====================\n\n\nScheduling of the agents is based on the [mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/) agent-based modeling library\n\nFor multi-segment larvae the spatial environment and bodies are simulated through [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) physics engine.\n\nOptionally neural modules can be implemented using the [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai/) neural simulator\n\nThe homeostasis/energetics module is based on the [DEB](http://www.debtheory.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) (Dynamic Energy Budget) Theory\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Installation**\n\nOpen linux/macOS terminal.\nNavigate to a directory of your choice.\nDownload or clone the repository to your local drive :\n\n    git clone https://github.com/nawrotlab/larvaworld.git\n\nEither make sure python 3.9 is your default python interpreter,\nOr optionally create a python 3.9 virtual environment, for example in folder `larvaworld_venv`, and activate it:\n\n    python3.9 -m venv larvaworld_venv\n\n    source larvaworld_venv/bin/activate\n\n\nInstall package dependencies :\n\n    cd larvaworld\n\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nAdd the virtual environment to jupyter so that you can run the notebooks\n\n    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=larvaworld_venv\n\n\n**Run Larvaworld**\n\nLarvaworld-GUI can be run directly from linux terminal.\nThe executable files are in `larvaworld/run` directory.\n\n    cd run\n\n\n   Larvaworld-GUI\n   =====================\n   All functionalities are availbale via the respective tabs of the larvaworld GUI.\n   Launch the GUI :\n\n      python larvaworld-gui\n\n\n   Larvaworld via Linux terminal\n   =========================================\n   Optionally Larvaworld can be launched through Linux terminal via the remaining two executable python files.\n   Help on how to use these can be found in the [tutorial notebook](tutorial/walkthrough.ipynb).\n   Three modes are available :\n\n\n\n   1.
