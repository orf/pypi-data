[y/N]:\n```\n\n## Deployment without using the CLI\n\nThe CLI allows a good amount of flexibility to meet your deployment requirements. But if you need to do a custom/manual deployment, follow these steps.\n- Deploy a VPC, domain server, subnets, route tables, network gateways, database and connect them altogether.\n\nAfter deploying the domain server, you would need to SSH into it and perform these tasks.\n- Install `Terraform`.\n- Clone `PyGrid`.\n- Set up environment variables (Eg. for amazon `DATABASE_URL`, `CLOUD_PROVIDER`, `REGION`, `VPC_ID`, `PUBLIC_SUBNET_ID`, `PRIVATE_SUBNET_ID`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)\n- Start the domain/network app using the `run.sh` file (found in respective app folders).\n```shell script\nnohup ./run.sh --port 5000 --host 0.0.0.0\n```\nFor better understanding of steps involved in setting up the domain, you can refer to our post-deployment scripts in the `write_domain_exec_script` function of the respective cloud provider classes (`AWS_Serverfull`, `Azure`, `GCP`) found in `apps/domain/src/main/core/infrastructure/providers/`.\n\n\n## Serverless deployment\n\nServerless deployment has risen in popularity in recent years for a variety of reasons:\n\n- Ease of deployment: You no longer need to be concerned about process management or configuring a network to accept appropriate incoming connections.\n- Auto-scaling: Serverless functions scale implicitly because of the fact that they are not running on a continuous process, and are instead \u201cinstantiated on-demand\u201d.\n- Inexpensive: Because you\u2019re not paying for a continuously running process, you\u2019re only paying when the function is called, which is significantly cheaper than paying for a constantly running server.\n\nAs such, PyGrid Domains and Networks, which are simply message forwarding services and API\u2019s with an attached SQL database, are great candidates for serverless deployment. Workers, on the other hand, due to their specific hardware requirements necessary for computation, should always be deployed in a \u201cserverfull\u201d (traditional) configuration. While this may sound expensive, if a Worker is deployed to a cloud provider then the data scientist has the ability to turn on and off the instance (the Worker) at their discretion.\n\n*Note: The PyGrid team wrote an initial serverless deployment setup for Domains and Networks. But, currently this functionality does not exist in a completed form. The current constraints are actually due to the fact that `PySyft` has a hard dependency on PyTorch at the moment. Currently it\u2019s not possible to utilize only the class structure required for parsing messages from PySyft without having to install PyTorch as well. Serverless functions often come with file size constraints, making this impossible or unrealistic. It\u2019s the PyGrid team\u2019s hope that this dependency is later marked as optional, allowing the team to simply utilize the PySyft class structure inside of PyGrid, without depending on any deep learning framework functionality.*\n\nIf serverless deployment becomes a reality for Domains and Networks, then it is our suggestion that you deploy Domains and Networks in a serverless configuration. This is the optimal method of deployment given cost, scaling concerns, and maintenance effort. Using this method, it could mean that a data owner would be able to host their private data in a PyGrid serverless deployment, and never need to be concerned with ongoing scale or maintenance of their deployment - truly a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d situation.\n\n\n",
