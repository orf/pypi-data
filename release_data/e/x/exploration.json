            "description": "# Exploration\n\n## Overview\n\nThis program provides data types for representing the exploration of\nspaces that can defined (or abstracted) in terms of discrete decisions,\nsuch as videogame levels with multiple rooms and also other things like\nconversation trees or a city block grid.\n\nIt represents space using a `DecisionGraph`, which is a multi-di-graph\nindicating the transition(s) between decisions, which can include\ninformation about prerequisites for transitions as well as effects a\ntransition might have on the world. There is also a convention for\nrepresenting unexplored regions using specially-tagged nodes of the\ngraph. An `Exploration` is a sequence of `DecisionGraph`s, along with a\nsequence of decisions indicating where the explorer was at each step, a\nsequence of transitions indicating which transition was taken at each\nstep, and a sequence of states indicating extra state at each step. These\nrepresentations were developed with Metroidvania games in mind.\n\nCore capabilities include:\n\n- Representing exploration processes as a series of decisions including\n    partial information about not-yet-explored decisions.\n- Creating maps and explorations from various text formats, including\n    exploration journal formats.\n- Reasoning about reachability modulo transition requirements in terms of\n    powers that must be possessed and/or tokens that must be spent for a\n    transition. TODO\n- The ability to represent fairly sophisticated game logic in the\n    `DecisionGraph`, and even construct playable maps. Game logic that\n    can't be captured this way can still be represented through making\n    custom changes to maps between exploration steps. TODO\n\n## Dependencies:\n\n- Python version 3.8+\n- `networkx` For underlying graph structures.\n- `pytest` for testing, install with `[test]` option to get it automatically.\n\n## Installing\n\nJust run `pip install exploration`. The `egtool` script should be\ninstalled along with the module.\n\nYou can then run `python -m exploration.tests` to run tests.\n\n## Getting Started:\n\nThe `egtool` script provides a command-line interface to core\nfunctionality. The `exploration.main` module provides equivalent entry\npoints from Python. `exploration.core` provides the main types and\nexplains how they fit together.\n\n## Plans\n\n- Better support for open-world games, where decisions are not as closely\n    linked to virtual space structure.\n\n## Changelog\n\n- v0.4 introduces the 'actionPart' target type so that you can do 'oa' to\n    observe an action without taking it. It also introduces long-form\n    entry types and targets: you can just write out the full name of an\n    entry type, possibly followed by an @ and either a full or\n    abbreviated target type. Hopefully this helps make things more\n    accessible for beginners. There are also now a few built-in debug\n    commands available for printing relvant stuff. More may be added as\n    they become popular. It also introduces equivalences, stored in the\n    `DecisionGraph`, which allow powers (but not tokens) to count as\n    being obtained when one of a set of other requirements is met\n    instead. The 'fulfills' journal entry can add these.\n- v0.3 is a pretty big overhaul. Changes journal format a bit (zones are\n    now easier to deal with). Adds command-line interface (`__main__.py`\n    via API in `main.py`). Adds interactive script `egtool`. Adds JSON\n    serialization and `__eq__` methods for `DecisionGraph` and\n    `Exploration` types. Fills out 'edit' effect type with a new\n    `Command` syntax which is it's own tiny DSL for editing\n    graphs/explorations. Also adds aliases in the journal format so that\n    it's easier to store/recall complex but repeated patterns. Extends\n    testing code quite a bit and fixes a fair number of bugs found via\n    those tests, although coverage is still incomplete. This version\n    pushes module compatibility up to 3.10 since the type checking code\n    is to tightly intertwined with the actual runtime code in places to\n    be easily separable and it uses 3.10 features. One final big change:\n    the default journal format has changed so that 'g' is for tag, 't'\n    (which used to be tag) is for 'retrace', and 'r' (which used to be\n    retrace) is for 'return'). 'R' is no longer used by the default\n    format. Note that until 1.0, there may continue to be some\n    instability in the default journal format.\n- v0.2 Journal functionality (`journal.py`) is working at a basic level,\n    with a few things still to-do (e.g., edit effects). Design has\n    changed since previous versions. The zone system now works, although\n    needs more testing. Design will be iterated on so the API and\n    particularly the journal format is not 100% stable yet. Changed\n    version support from 3.7+ to 3.8+ because of needing typing.Literal.\n- v0.1.2 Core functionality (`core.py`) is working & tested, with the\n    exception of the zones system. Journals are not working, and tests\n    for those have been disabled for now. Could be used for\n    representation purposes, but is not yet complete. This version is\n    effectively the first alpha release since I'm demoing at the PCG\n    workshop. Note most of the 'core capabilities' are still TODO.\n- v0.1.1 Still pre-alpha as it's in the process of being re-architected a\n    bit, but some core functionality is present if rough (e.g.,\n    `core.DecisionGraph` and `core.Exploration`).\n- v0.1 Initial pre-alpha upload.\n",
