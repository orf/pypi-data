            "description": "Sudoku Maker\n============\n\n.. |--| unicode:: U+2013   .. en dash\n\n:Author: Ralf Schlatterbeck <rsc@runtux.com>\n\nSudoku Maker is a generator for Sudoku number puzzles. It uses a genetic\nalgorithm internally, so it can serve as an introduction to genetic\nalgorithms. The generated Sudokus are usually very hard to solve |--| good\nfor getting rid of a Sudoku addiction (or maybe not).\n\nIt also includes a simple depth-first solver for sudoku puzzles |--| the\nsolver is internally needed when generating sudoku puzzles. The included\n``sudoku.py`` can be called and reads a sudoku from standard input.\nIt outputs the solution (if any) or if there isn't a single solution to\nthe given puzzle it will output several (up to a maximum).\n\nThe representation of sudoku puzzles is a simple: 9 lines with 9 numbers\nin each line, e.g., ::\n\n    010070800\n    000008000\n    706000003\n    000009120\n    000006050\n    003004007\n    090010002\n    200000400\n    000450900\n\nThe numbers 1-9 represent the given numbers of the puzzle while the\nzeros represent the empty tiles. A solved puzzle simply contains no\nzeros. I've adopted the file extension ``.sud`` for this format.\nThe puzzle in the example was created by ``sudokumaker`` with the option\n``-r 1`` which sets the random seed to 1, so the puzzle should be\nreproduceable with this option (on a 64bit architecture).\nThe example above when rendered with ``sudoku_as_tex`` and\ncompiled with LaTeX will look something like the following:\n\n.. image:: r1.png\n\nThere are some variants of sudoku puzzles supported. The first variant\nadds the diagonals (so in each of the two diagonals the numbers 1-9 must\nbe present), this variant can be requested with the ``--diagonal``\noption. A printed example (which was again generated with the random seed\n1 but now with the ``--diagonal`` option) looks as follows:\n\n.. image:: diag-r1.png\n\nFor the diagonal variant I've adopted the extension ``.sudd`` |--| note\nthat the normal sudoku and the diagonal-constrained sudokus are not\ncompatible, if interpreted as a normal sudoku, a diagonal-constrained\nsudoku would have multiple solutions.\n\nThe second variant requires that in each quadrant there are 9 distinct\ncolors, the same color is always at the same position in each quadrant.\nThe numbers 1-9 must be present on each of the colors.\nFor this variant I've adopted the extension ``.sudc``, as with\ndiagonal-constrained sudokus, color-constrained sudokus would have\nmultiple solutions if interpreted as a normal sudoku.  This variant can\nbe requested with the ``--colorconstrained`` option. An example looks as\nfollows:\n\n.. image:: color-r1.png\n\nSudoku puzzles can be pretty-printed as LaTeX using the included\n``sudoku_as_tex`` program. This currently supports printing the\ndiagonals in yellow if the ``--diagonal`` option is given.\nColor-constrained sudokus can be printed with the ``--colorconstrained``\noption. The following color map applies:\n\n============ ======\ncolor        letter\n============ ======\nred          r\npink         p\nviolet       v\ngrey         g\norange       o\nyellow       y\nlight green  l\ndark green   d\nblue         b\n============ ======\n\nIf these letters are used in the color constrained sudoku, the table\nabove applies. Other letters can be used, too, but the color assignment\nfor printing will be arbitrary in that case.\n\nA third variant, sometimes called *kikagaku* has irregular colored\nshapes *instead* of the 3X3 blocks. These can currently only be printed\nusing the ``--kikagaku`` option to ``sudoku_as_tex`` but *not* be\ngenerated using ``sudokumaker``. The format I'm using for these is a\nmodification of the ``.sud`` format. It contains the numbers in the same\nformat as in ``.sud`` followed by lines with letters where each letter\nrepresents a unique color. Of course each letter has to appear exactly 9\ntimes.  I've not included a puzzle because I currently cannot generated\nthem automatically. An empty puzzle in that format would look as follows::\n\n    000000000\n    000000000\n    000000000\n    000000000\n    000000000\n    000000000\n    000000000\n    000000000\n    000000000\n    rrrrvvvvg\n    brbrrvggg\n    brbrovvvg\n    bbbbovggg\n    blooooogp\n    llldopppp\n    ldddoypyp\n    llldyypyp\n    lddddyyyy\n\nThe same color map as for color-constrained sudoku puzzle applies.\nThis would be rendered as follows:\n\n.. image:: kik.png\n\nFor the genetic algorithm library, my python wrapper *pgapy* of the\nparallel genetic algorithm library (pgapack) is needed. There is\ncurrently no Windows support for *pgapy* but recent changes to *may* be\na step in the right direction: PGAPack is now bundled with *pgapy*.\nFor a skilled person it should be possible to\nget PGAPack running on Windows, so if you're doing this, let me know.\n\nVersion 1.0: Mark as stable, Python3\n\nNow marked as Development Status Production/Stable\n\n- Python3\n- Stable\n- Remove SF logo\n- Documentation update, pictures\n- Add rendered examples\n\nVersion 0.4: Packaging fixes\n\nFix package name again, stick to sudokumaker to avoid name collisions.\n\n- Package namespace is now sudokumaker again\n- Sudokumaker depends on rsclib.sourceforge.net\n\nVersion 0.3: Color, Diagonal\n\nNow color constrained and diagonality constrained sudokus are supported.\n\n- Diagonality constrained sudokus must have the digits 1-9 in the\n  diagonals, too. When printing, diagonals are printed in yellow.\n- Color constrained sudokus have 9 additional colors which are in the\n  same position in every quadrant. These must have the digits 1-9, too.\n  When printing we chose 9 different light colors.\n\nVersion 0.2: README update\n\nThe README (and the SF homepage which is generated from it) had wrong\nlink to the project. Also the python package index didn't accept one of\nmy classifier. Grmpf.\n\n- Fix project link in README (SF Logo)\n- Remove one classifier not accepted by pypi\n\nVersion 0.1: Initial Release\n\nSudoku Maker is a generator for Sudoku number puzzles. It uses a genetic\nalgorithm internally.\n\n- First Release after a long silent development\n",
