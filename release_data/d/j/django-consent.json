But let's instead imagine how we would want our\nown data to handled on a website.\n\n* An app for Django - ``pip install django-consent``\n* Free software: GNU General Public License v3\n* Privacy by Design\n* Privacy by Default\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Models: GDPR-friendly, supporting deletion and anonymization\n* Views: For managing withdrawal of consent from email links\n* Easy utility functions: for creating consent, generating unsubscribe links etc.\n* Form mixins: Create your own forms with consent description and checkbox\n* Abuse-resistent: Uses unique URLs and `django-ratelimit <https://django-ratelimit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.\n* Denial of Service: Endpoints do not store for instance infinite amounts of\n  opt-outs.\n* Email confirmation: Signing up people via email requires to have the email\n  confirmed.\n\n\nOpen design questions\n---------------------\n\nSince this is a new project, some questions are still open for discussion.\nThis project prefers the simplicity of maximum privacy, but to ensure no\nmisunderstandings and openness about decisions, refer to the following.\n\n* **Can or should consent expire?** Currently, we are capturing the creation date of\n  a consent, but we are not using expiration dates.\n\n* **Would some email addresses qualify as non-individual, and thus require**\n  **different types of consent?** For instance, should company/customer email\n  addresses be stored in a way so that certain consents become optional?\n  Currently, all consent is explicit and stored that way.\n\n* **Should django-consent also capture purpose and more generic ways of storing**\n  **private data?** Currently, we are only capturing email-related consent.\n\n* **Do we want to store consent indefinitely?** No. If consent is withdrawn, we\n  should delete the entire consent. A person would have to create an entirely\n  new consent.\n\n* **Should we store op-outs indefinitely?** Partly. In django-consent, we do this\n  because we want opt-outs to remain in effect. But we store a hash of the email\n  such that it we don't keep a record of emails. Experience with Mailchimp and\n  similar systems tell us that marketing and other eager types will keep\n  re-importing consent and forget to care about previous opt-outs. By storing an\n  opt-out, we can ensure to some degree that mistakes made will not result in\n  clearly non-consensual communication.\n\n* **What if we edit consent definitions?** This application is set up to send a\n  copy of what the user consented to via email. If you later change something of\n  real meaning in your own copy, you should ask for consent again. So ideally,\n  you would create a new consent object in the database. This project doesn't\n  seek to support the dark pattern of companies continuously updating their\n  consent and telling users that \"by continuing to use this service, you consent\n  to the below thousand lines of legal lingo that you don't have time to read\".\n\n\nIssues are welcomed with the tag ``question`` to verify, challenge elaborate or\nadd to this list.\n\n\nPrivacy by Design\n-----------------\n\nYour application needs the ability to easily delete and anonymize data. Not just\nbecause of GDPR, but because it's the right thing to do.\n\nNo matter the usage of django-consent, you still need to consider this:\n\n* Right to be forgotten: Means that at any time, you should be able to\n  **delete** the data of any person. Either by request or because the purpose of\n  collecting the data is no longer relevant.\n\n* Anonymize data: When your consent to collect data associated to a person\n  expires and if you need to keep a statistical record, the data must be\n  completely anonymized. For instance, if they made an order in your shop and\n  your stored data about shopping cart activity, you'll have to delete or\n  anonymize this data.\n\nIn any implementation, you should consider how you associate personally\nidentifiable information. This can be a name, email, IP address, physical\naddress and unique combinations (i.e. employer+job+department).\n\nIn order to design a Django project for privacy, consider the following:\n\n* Right to be forgotten:\n\n  * Deletion should be implemented through deletion of a ``User`` instance. Do\n    not relate personally identifiable data in other ways.\n  * All model relations to ``User.id`` should use ``on_delete=models.CASCADE``\n\n* Anonymization:\n\n  * When a relation to ``User.id`` has ``null=True`` and is nullified, then\n    remaining data in the model should not identify the person. You should design\n    your models to only allow null values for ``User`` relations when in fact the\n    remaining data in the row and its relations cannot be used to identify the\n    person from your data.\n\n\nPrivacy by Default\n------------------\n\nConsider the following:\n\n* Minimize your data collection. Collect as little as possible for your purpose.\n* Encrypt\n* Backups are not trivial\n\n\nLegal disclaimer\n----------------\n\nEvery individual implementation should do its own legal assessment as necessary.\n\nThe GPL v3 license which this is distributed under also applies to the\ndocumentation and this README:\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The former package is archived\nhere: https://github.com/d0ugal/django-consent\n\n\n",
