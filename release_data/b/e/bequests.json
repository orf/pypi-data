            "description": "\nSEATTLE 1988\n\nEXT. FRONT YARD.  DAY.\n\nSlow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of\nunmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class\nresidential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in\nshock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram\nto the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed\nRottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades\npoint M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be\nambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An\nattractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.\n\nNow, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the\nfront door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.\n\nINT. MURPHY RESIDENCE. DAY.\n\n\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t(screams)\n\tOough! Ahhh!\n\n\t\tSECRET SERVICE AGENT\n\t\t(to others)\n\tUpstairs.\n\nTroops pour into the house.\n\n\t\tWOMAN\n\tWhat's going on? What's the matter?\n\tWho are you?\n\nThe troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue\nentering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles\nready.\n\n\t\tWOMAN\n\tHey!\n\nUpstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops\ndescend on a bedroom.\n\n\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t(off camera)\n\tDade! Dade!\n\n\t\tAGENT\n\tKnock it down.\n\nThe battering ram knocks down a bedroom door.\n\nINT. COURTROOM.\n\nThe prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing\nargument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else.\n\n\t\tPROSECUTOR\n\tThe defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls\n\thimself \"Zero Cool\", has repeatedly\n\tcommitted criminal acts of a malicious\n\tnature. This defendant possesses a\n\tsuperior intelligence, which he uses to a\n\tdestructive and antisocial end. His\n\tcomputer virus crashed one thousand five\n\thundred and seven computer systems,\n\tincluding Wall Street trading systems,\n\tsingle handedly causing a seven point drop\n\tin the New York Stock Market.\n\nAs she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning\ndown and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade\nMurphy.\n\nFast forward to the sentencing.\n\n\t\tJUDGE\n\tDade Murphy, I hereby fine your family\n\tforty-five thousand dollars...\n\nThe court gasps, Dade's father winces\n\n\t\tJUDGE\n\t...and sentence you to probation, under\n\twhich you are forbidden to own or operate\n\ta computer or touch tone telephone, until\n\tthe day of your eighteenth birthday.\n\nNow Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry.\n\nOpening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family\nand lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and\nphotographers, in slow motion, and driving away.\n\n\t    SEVEN YEARS LATER.\n\nAboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the\nwindow, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the\naircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a\ndirect overhead of the buildings and streets of the city,\nwhich then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips\nand digital signals on a stylised computer board. The\ntitle logo.\n\nINT. DADE'S ROOM.\n\nSegue to Dade Murphy, now 18, wearing mirrorshades indoors\nand at night, working on his new computer. His mother\ncalls him.\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\t\t(off camera)\n\tDade?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYeah, mom?\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\tWhat are you doing?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\t\t(after a semi-pregnant pause)\n\tI'm taking over a TV network.\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\tFinish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy\n\tbirthday.\n\nINT. OTV STUDIOS.\n\nIn the OTV Studios security department, a phone rings, a\nman answers nervously.\n\n\t\tNORM\n\tSecurity, uh Norm, Norm speaking.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tNorman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from\n\tAccounting. I just had a power surge here at\n\thome that wiped out a file I was working on.\n\tListen, I'm in big trouble, do you know\n\tanything about computers?\n\n\t\tNORM\n\tUhhmmm... uh gee, uh...\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tRight, well my BLT drive on my computer just\n\twent AWOL, and I've got this big project due\n\ttomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get\n\tit in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari\n\tKari...\n\n\t\tNORM\n\tUhhh.. ahahaha...\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYeah, well, you know these Japanese management\n\ttechniques.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tCould you, uh, read me the number on the\n\tmodem?\n\n\t\tNORM\n\tUhhhmm...\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tIt's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches\n\ton it... lets my computer talk to the one\n\tthere...\n\n\t\tNORM\n\t212-555-4240.\n\nDade goes to work on OTV. He closes his eyes and a flurry\nof half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by.\nHe opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and\nthen wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback\nSystem. There is a graphic representation of the\nstation's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his\nTV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh\ntype TV show.\n\n\t\tCOMMENTATOR\n\t\t(on TV)\n\t...so-called American Indians, Latinos and\n\tBlacks come from a genetically mediocre\n\tstock...\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYak yak yak. Get a job!\n\nDade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer\ndiagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm\nselects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of\ntapes.  The \"America First\" tape slides out of the VTR and\nis replaced by an episode of \"The Outer Limits\" as Dade\nwatches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.\n\n\t\tTV\n\tYou are about to experience the awe and\n\tmystery, which reaches from the inner mind,\n\tto... The Outer Limits.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYesssss!\n\nSuddenly, the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous\nmessage:\n\n\t    U HAVE TREAD\n\t    UPON MY DOMAIN &\n\t    MUST NOW SUFFER\n\t    WHO R U?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tHey! What?\n\nHe starts to type ZERO...\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tNo, wait.\n\nDade types:\n\n\t    CRASH OVERRIDE.\n\t    WHO WANTS TO KNOW?\n\nDade's screen dissolves into:\n\n\t    ACID BURN\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tUnbelievable. A hacker!\n\nThen the screen changes again:\n\n\t    ACID BURN\n\t    SEZ LEAVE B 4\n\t    U R EXPUNGED\n\n\"The Outer Limits\" suddenly flashes off.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYeah, okay \"Acid Burn\", that's enough.\n\nDade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The\ntape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes\nfighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps\nchanging.\n\nThe message comes up on Dade's computer screen:\n\n\t    I WILL\n\t    SWAT U LIKE\n\t    THE FLY U R\n\nMore dueling tape changers, more half second video clips.\nAnother message.\n\n\t    I WILL\n\t    SNAP YOUR BACK\n\t    LIKE A TOOTHPICK\n\nAs the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:\n\n\t    MESS WITH THE BEST\n\t    DIE LIKE THE REST\n\nOne last from Acid Burn:\n\n\t    YOU ARE\n\t    TERMINATED\n\nThen his own computer confirms for him that the connection\nis terminated.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tShit on me!\n\nNext morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges\nfrom his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging\nmoving boxes) for the fridge.\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\tGood morning. You unpack your stuff yet?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tMm-hmm.\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\tUp all night again, huh?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tCan this wait until both my eyes are open,\n\tplease?\n\nDade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the\nbuilding superintendent.\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\tCan I cut the electricity to his room so he'll\n\tsleep normal hours? He's been playing with\n\this computer all night for a solid week.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tWell yes, he could be playing with himself.\n\tMmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls,\n\tdon't you?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tWell, yeah, I just haven't found one as\n\tcharming as you yet.\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\tYou haven't been doing anything stupid, right,\n\tDade?\n\t\t(louder)\n\tRight, Dade?!\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tRight, mom. And I'm still a virgin!\n\nDade slams the bathroom door. Mrs. Murphy quickly checks\nhis room. Dade is showering.\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\t\t(angry, through the bathroom door)\n\tYou hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?\n\tDade! Turn the shower off! You screw up\n\tagain and you won't get into college!\n\nShe pauses and regains some of her cool.\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\tI'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.\n\tI didn't want to sell the house but I had to\n\ttake this new job, you know that. You're\n\tgoing to love New York, it's the city that\n\tnever sleeps!\n\nEXT. NEW YORK CITY.\n\nWe enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun\nshining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day\nand night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment\non rollerblades and skates down the street to school.\n\nINT. HIGH SCHOOL.\n\nAt school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,\nhead to class.  Dade looks lost among them. He walks up\nto a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle\nshirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tExcuse me.\n\n\t\tKID\n\tYo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the\n\tprincipal's office.\n\n\t\tKID\n\tSorry, I can't help you, okay?\n\nNow Dade really looks lost. He heads off in search of the\noffice.\n\nINT. OFFICE.\n\nDade is filling out a form.\n\n\t\tGIRL\n\tDo you have your transfer forms?\n\nDade stares at her, stunned. The girl has a decidedly\nunconventional appearance, yet is a first-rate beauty.\n\n\t\tGIRL\n\tIt's a relatively straightforward question.\n\nDade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches\ninto a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites,\nall involving lips and kissing.\n\n\t\tGIRL\n\tDo you speak English?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tSorry, you wanted...?\n\n\t\tGIRL\n\tI wanted transfer forms.\n\nHe gives them to her.\n\n\t\tGIRL\n\tThank you.\n\nShe starts leaving. He doesn't.\n\n\t\tGIRL\n\tAre you coming?\n\nDade clues in, gets up and follows her. She takes him on\na brief tour.\n\nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.\n\n\t\tGIRL\n\tThe gym is through there, and the cafeteria is\n\tthrough there.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tGreat. Cool.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tWhat's your name?\n\n\t\tGIRL\n\tKate. Kate Libby.\n\nThey arrive at a classroom.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tHere's your class.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tMy... class. You mean I'm not in your class?\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tNo, you're not in my class.\n\nKate starts away.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tGive me time!\n\nA guy in the halls notices Dade.\n\n\t\tGUY\n\tHey, you new?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYeah.\n\n\t\tGUY\n\tTell him about the pool, Kate.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tPool?\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tYeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up\n\ton the roof. Take the stairs over there.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYeah! Sure.\n\nKate starts away again.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tThanks!\n\nEXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP.\n\nDade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the\nroof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over\nthe edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.\nOne of them notices Dade.\n\n\t\tGEEK\n\tHey! Hold the door!\n\nHe's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.\n\n\t\tDade\n\t\t(realizing he's been had)\n\tNo pool.\n\nDade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with\nhis palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins\nraining.\n\nINT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR.\n\nDade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates\nleaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls\nthrough his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled\nin an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tOh my God! He found the pool.\n\nINT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB.\n\nThe kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade\nis hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to\nVenezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing\nskeletons.\n\n\t\tTEACHER\n\tI'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms.\n\tBayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur\n\trally. I know some of you kids got computers\n\tat home. But these are school property,\n\tpeople, and I don't want to see any gum stuck\n\tto 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical\n\tinterface...\n\nMeanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been\nlooking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking\nhimself into her advanced English class.\n\nEXT. SCHOOL QUAD.\n\nIt's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The\nlatino kid notices Dade and catches up with him.\n\n\t\tKID\n\tSo, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby,\n\teh? Academic? Purely sexual?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tHomicidal?\n\n\t\tKID\n\tWhat's up, man? I'm the Phreak!\n\nThe name rings no bells with Dade.\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tThe Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I\n\tknow you play the game.\n\nAnother kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up\nto Dade and The Phantom Phreak.\n\n\t\tJOEY\n\tPhreakphreakphreakphreakphreak,\n\tdudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\t\t(slaps Joey)\n\tJoey, Joey...\n\n\t\tJOEY\n\tWhat? whatwhatwhat?\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tOne more \"dude\" out of you and I'm gonna slap\n\tthe shit outa you, okay?

NEW YORK CITY STREET VILLAGE. NIGHT.\n\nDade rolls in on rollerblades.  Street vendors hawk\ncomputer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music\nvendor catches Dade's attention.\n\n\t\tCEREAL\n\tCheck this out, each and every one of you.\n\tCompilation tape, of my own making. I call\n\tthis the \"Greatest Zooks Album\".

It speaks.\n\n\t\tPLAGUE\n\tYou wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well\n\tlet me explain the New World Order.\n\tGovernments and corporations need people like\n\tyou and me. We are samurai.

Ahh,\n\tthink about it. Enjoy the laptop, \"Cool\"!\n\tTell me where the disk is.\n\nPlague's face vanishes.\n\nINT. JOEY'S ROOM.\n\nJoey lies on his bed with a comic book, looking\ndespondent. His mother enters.\n\n\t\tJOEY'S MOM\n\tYou look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not\n\tgrounded anymore.\n\nShe kisses his forehead and leaves. He springs back to\nlife, gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it\nin the air vent.\n\nEXT. PARK.\n\nJoey is nervously waiting on a park bench. Phreak arrives.\nAgents Ray and Bob still have Joey staked out.\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tYo, what's up?\n\n\t\tJOEY\n\tDude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute,\n\tlisten listen listen.

I don't know.\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tJoey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data.\n\tJunk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.\n\n\t\tJOEY\n\tI copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're\n\tasking me about it, alright? Will you take a\n\tlook for me?\n\nJoey hands Phreak the disc. Agent Bob is taking pictures,\nand Phreak notices.\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tOh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.\n\nJoey sees, and runs for it.\n\n\t\tJOEY\n\tShit!\n\nThe agents split up, one runs after Joey, the other after\nPhreak.\n\nINT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.\n\nPhreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a\ncondom machine in the boys' room at school, and sticks it\nthere with gum.\n\nINT. PHREAK'S ROOM.\n\nPhreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking\ncareer. He knows he's about to be busted.\n\nDREAM SEQUENCE.\n\nThe Secret Service is about to burst in on Phreak.

Vamano.\n\tTime for school, come on.\n\nThe secret service bursts in through the window just as\nPhreak's mom opens the blind. She screams, Phreak leaps\nto his feet.\n\n\t\tAGENT\n\tSecret Service, don't move!\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tDeja vu!\n\n\t\tAGENT BOB\n\tRay Sanchez, you are under arrest, under the\n\tComputer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.\n\nPhreak's mom becomes very angry and starts slapping\nPhreak, cursing in Spanish.\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tWhat are you waiting for, arrest me already!\n\nINT. POLICE STATION LOCKUP.\n\nThe undersized Phreak is just a morsel to the hardened\nthugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he\nis led to his one phone call.\n\n\t\tCOP\n\tYou get one call. Uno. Understand?\n\nThe cop locks the dial on the phone.\n\nPhreak waits for the cop to leave, and hangs up. He\nstarts rapidly pushing the hangup hook, and he hears a\nringing tone.\n\n\t\tOPERATOR\n\tHello, operator services.\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tHello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a\n\tnumber.\n\n\t\tOPERATOR\n\tWhat number please?\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\t555-4202.\n\n\t\tOPERATOR\n\tJust one moment.\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tThank you.\n\nKate answers.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tHello?\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tHey, it's me.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tPhreak?\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tI'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He\n\treally hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the\n\tdisc with a file he copied and now I'm in\n\tjail! They're charging me with some serious\n\tshit! And there's stuff I didn't even do,\n\tlike inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and\n\tthey keep asking about you guys.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tYou think they're going to bust us?\n\n\t\tPHREAK\n\tYeah! You better figure out what's on that\n\tdisc, cause we're being framed. It's in that\n\tplace where I put that thing that time?\n\nHe hangs up just as the cop returns.\n\nINT. SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.\n\nKate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the\nboys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the\ncondom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from\nthe machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.\n\nINT. DADE'S PLACE.\n\nKate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in.\n\n\t\tMRS.

Truce, you guys. Listen, we got\n\ta higher purpose here, alright? A wake up\n\tcall for the Nintendo Generation. We demand\n\tfree access to data, well, it comes with some\n\tresponsibility. When I was a child, I spake\n\tas a child, I understood as a child, I thought\n\tas a child, but when I became a man I put away\n\tchildish things.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tWhat... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse\n\t11, no duh. Come on.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tPhreak and Joey are being framed. We need\n\tyour help to figure out what's on this disc.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tI can't. Everybody who touches that thing\n\tgets busted, I can't afford to get arrested,\n\tI'm sorry.\n\n\t\tCEREAL\n\tMaybe I should just go to the bathroom or\n\tsomething.\n\nCereal leaves the room.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tWhat is it with you? I know we've been\n\tplaying games, but, we're supposed to be on\n\tthe same side and we really need your help. I\n\treally need your help.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tI'm sorry, I can't.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tWell, could you just make a copy of the disc?\n\tAnd just hide it in case we get busted, so we\n\thave something to give our lawyers, something\n\tthat hasn't been tampered with? Can you do\n\tthat?\n\nA knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in.\n\n\t\tMRS. MURPHY\n\tListen you guys, help yourself to anything in\n\tthe fridge. Cereal has.\n\nShe leaves.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\t\t(to Mrs. Murphy)\n\tThank you.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tOkay. I'll copy it.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tOkay, thank you.\n\nLater.  Plague phones Dade. Plague has Lauren Murphy's\nrecords on his screen.\n\n\t\tPLAGUE\n\tThe girl. The girl has the disc I need.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tI told you, I don't play well with others.\n\n\t\tPLAGUE\n\tTurn on your laptop. Set it to receive a\n\tfile.\n\nDade does.\n\nAn extensive criminal record with a strange woman's\npicture comes up. The strange woman transforms into\nDade's mother.\n\n\t\tPLAGUE\n\tLauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the\n\tstate of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement,\n\ttwo drug convictions, plus she jumped parole.\n\tWhen she's arrested, she will not have a\n\ttrial, she will not pass go, she will go\n\tdirectly to jail. Then I change this file\n\tback to the original, and your mom disappears.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tThat's bullshit.\n\n\t\tPLAGUE\n\tWhat can I tell you. Computers never lie,\n\tkid. Your mom will be arrested at work,\n\tshe'll be handcuffed, and later, strip\n\tsearched.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYou lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.\n\n\t\tPLAGUE\n\tKid, don't threaten me. There are worse\n\tthings than death and, uh, I can do all of\n\tthem!\n\nDade emerges from his room. His exhausted, overworked\nmother is asleep on the couch. He pulls a blanket over\nher.\n\nEXT. PUBLIC PHONE, WET STREET, NIGHT.\n\nShortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone.\n\n\t\tPLAGUE\n\tTalk to me.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tI got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's\n\ton it. I mean, she came to me to figure it\n\tout. She's not the one who planted the virus.\n\tYou leave her alone.\n\n\t\tPLAGUE\n\tHey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent,\n\tshe'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?\n\nDade hangs up and waits for some time.  A limousine drives\nby, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc,\njumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase\nbut gives up quickly.\n\nINT. KATE'S ROOM.\n\nDade shows up.  Kate, Nikon, and Cereal are working on the\ndisc.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tKate, listen.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tUh, hold on...\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tI have to tell you something.\n\n\t\tCEREAL\n\tHold on a second!\n\n\t\tNIKON\n\tLook at this, it's so lean and clean.\n\n\t\tCEREAL\n\tLooks like a hacker wrote it.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tCome here, look at this. This thing is dense.\n\nNikon points out part of the code.\n\n\t\tNIKON\n\tBut that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This\n\tis taking forever and a day to figure out.\n\tI'm gonna make some coffee.\n\nDade takes Nikon's place.\n\n\t\tCEREAL\n\tTag, you're in.\n\nHours pass. Dade studies and reverse engineers the\ngarbage file. The other hackers watch, and do just about\nanything but be hackers. Finally, over boxes of\nhalf-finished pizza, Dade makes an announcement.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tThis isn't a virus. It's a worm!\n\n\t\tNIKON\n\tWhat's this one eat?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tIt nibbles. You see this?\n\nDade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tThis is every financial transaction Ellingson\n\tconducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to\n\tthe ten bucks some guy pays for gas.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tThe worm eats a few cents from each transaction.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tAnd no one's caught it because the money isn't\n\treally gone. It's just data being shifted\n\taround.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tRight. And when the worm's ready, it zips out\n\twith the money and erases its tracks.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tJoey got cut off before he got to that part.\n\tCheck it out. By this point, it's already\n\trunning at, what, twice the speed as when it\n\tstarted.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tRight, and at this rate it ends its run in...\n\n\t\tNIKON\n\tTwo days.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tAnd judging by this segment alone, it's\n\talready eaten about...\n\n\t\tCEREAL\n\t21.8 million bucks, man.\n\nNikon whistles.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tWhoever wrote this needs somebody to take the\n\tfall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and\n\tthat's us. We've got to get the rest of the\n\tfile, so we can find out where the money is\n\tgoing before the worm disappears, so we can\n\tfind out WHO created it.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tI know, I know who wrote it.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tWhat?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tThis Ellingson security creep. I gave him a\n\tcopy of the disc you gave me.\n\n\t\tKATE\n\tYou what?\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tI didn't know what was on it.\n\n\t\tCEREAL\n\t\t(agitated)\n\tOh man.

OUTSIDE ELLINGSON BUILDING.\n\nDade and Kate cut through a chain link fence and jump into\na dumpster at Ellingson. Kate lands on Dade.\n\n\t\tDADE\n\tYou know, if I didn't live by a strict code of\n\thonor, I might take advantage of this\n\tsituation.  Erotically, as it were.\n\nKate fishes around in her pants, never breaking eye\ncontact with Dade. She pulls out a flashlight. They\nstart trashing. They get up to leave and are spotted by a\nsecurity guard.\n\n\t\tGUARD\n\tAlright, hold it right there!\n\nKate pulls out a flare gun and fires it at the security\nguard.

World domination?\n\tNay. Something far more tacky. A virus called\n\tDa Vinci, that when launched, would cause\n\tEllingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be\n\tblamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was\n\treally the smokescreen, right. What could be\n\tso vitally important to protect that someone\n\twould create such a nasty, antisocial, very\n\tuncool virus program?\n\nCereal is now seen and heard on the big screen in Times\nSquare.\n\n\t\tCEREAL\n\tBut why? Could it be to cover the tracks for\n\tthis worm program? A worm that was to steal 25\n\tmillion bucks.
