            "description": "# rds2py\n\nParse, extract and create Python representations for datasets stored in RDS files. It supports Bioconductor's `SummarizedExperiment` and `SingleCellExperiment` objects. This is possible because of [Aaron's rds2cpp library](https://github.com/LTLA/rds2cpp). \n\nThe package uses memory views (except for strings) so that we can access the same memory from C++ space in Python (through Cython of course). This is especially useful for large datasets so we don't make copies of data.\n\n## Install\n\nPackage is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rds2py/)\n\n```shell\npip install rds2py\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you do not have an RDS object handy, feel free to download from [single-cell-test-files](https://github.com/jkanche/random-test-files/releases).\n\n```python\nfrom rds2py import as_SCE, read_rds\n\nrObj = read_rds(<path_to_file>)\n```\n\nThis `rObj` contains the realized structure of the RDS file as a compatible `dict` object. The package provides friendly functions to easily convert R representations to more useful python representations.\n\n```python\nfrom rds2py import as_spase_matrix, as_SCE\n\n# to convert an robject to a sparse matrix\nsp_mat = as_sparse(rObj)\n\n# to convert an robject to SCE\nsce = as_SCE(rObj)\n```\n\nFor more use cases reading `data.frame`, `dgCMatrix`, `dgRMatrix` etc, checkout the [documentation](https://biocpy.github.io/rds2py/)\n\n\n## Developer Notes\n\nThis project uses Cython to provide bindings from C++ to Python and tries to use the same memory space (except for strings) instead of making copy of the data.\n\nSteps to properly setup\n\n- git submodules is initialized in `extern/rds2cpp`\n- `cmake .` in `extern/rds2cpp` directory to download dependencies, especially the `byteme` library\n\nFirst one needs to build the extern library, this would generate a shared object file to `src/rds2py/core-[*].so`\n\n```shell\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace\n```\n\nFor typical development workflows, run\n\n```shell\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace && tox\n```\n\n\n<!-- pyscaffold-notes -->\n\n## Note\n\nThis project has been set up using PyScaffold 4.3. For details and usage\ninformation on PyScaffold see https://pyscaffold.org/.\n",
