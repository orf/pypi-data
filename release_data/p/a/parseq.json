            "description": "\r\nParSeq\r\n======\r\n\r\nPackage ParSeq is a python software library for **Par**\\ allel execution\r\nof **Seq**\\ uential data analysis. It implements a general analysis\r\nframework with an adjustable data model (supports grouping, renaming, moving\r\nand drag-and-drop), plotters for 1D, 2D and 3D data, cross-data analysis\r\nroutines and flexible widget work space suitable for single- and multi-screen\r\ncomputers. It also gives a structure to implement particular analysis pipelines\r\nas relatively lightweight Python packages.\r\n\r\nParSeq is intended for synchrotron based techniques, first of all spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nA screenshot of a scanning XES analysis pipeline as an application example:\r\n\r\n.. image:: _images/node1.png\r\n   :scale: 50 %\r\n\r\nMain features\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n-  ParSeq allows creating analysis pipelines as lightweight modules. The above\r\n   example (scanning XES) is ~1000 lines with ~50% of them defining the four\r\n   analysis widgets.\r\n\r\n-  Flexible use of screen area by detachable/dockable transformation nodes\r\n   (parts of analysis pipeline).\r\n\r\n-  Two ways of acting from GUI onto multiple data: (a) simultaneous work with\r\n   multiply selected data and (b) applying a specific parameter or a group of\r\n   parameters to a later selected subset of data.\r\n\r\n-  Undo and redo for most of treatment steps.\r\n\r\n-  Entering into the analysis pipeline at any node, not only at the head of the\r\n   pipeline.\r\n\r\n-  Creation of cross-data combinations (e.g. averaging, RMS or PCA) and their\r\n   propagation downstream the pipeline together with the parental data. The\r\n   possibility of termination of the parental data at any selected downstream\r\n   node.\r\n\r\n-  Parallel execution of data analysis with multiprocessing or multithreading\r\n   (can be opted by the piplene application).\r\n\r\n-  Export of the workflow into a project file. Export of data into various data\r\n   formats (so far unstructured) with accompanied Python scripts that visualize\r\n   the exported data for the user to tune their publication plots.\r\n\r\n-  ParSeq understands container files (presently only hdf5) and adds them to\r\n   the system file tree as subfolders. The file tree, including hdf5\r\n   containers, is lazy loaded thus enabling big data collections.\r\n\r\n-  A web viewer widget near each analysis widget for displaying help pages\r\n   built from doc strings. The help pages are built by Sphinx at the startup\r\n   time.\r\n\r\nParSeq creates a data analysis pipeline consisting of nodes and transformations\r\nthat connect the nodes. The pipeline is fed with data (spectra or images),\r\npossibly entering the pipeline at various nodes. The pipeline can be operated\r\nvia scripts or GUI. The mechanisms for creating nodes and transformations,\r\nconnecting them together and creating Qt widgets for the transformations are\r\nexemplified by separately installed analysis packages:\r\n\r\n- `ParSeq-XES-scan <https://github.com/kklmn/ParSeq-XES-scan>`_\r\n- `ParSeq-XES-dispersive <https://github.com/kklmn/ParSeq-XES-dispersive>`_\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- `silx <https://github.com/silx-kit/silx>`_ -- used for plotting and Qt imports.\r\n- `sphinx <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx>`_ -- for building html documentation.\r\n\r\nLaunch an example\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nEither install ParSeq and a ParSeq pipeline application by their installers to\r\nthe standard location or put them to any folder, rename them to their package\r\nnames (``parseq`` and e.g. ``parseq_XES_scan``) and start the ``*_start.py``\r\nfile of the pipeline. You can try it with ``--test`` to load test data and/or\r\n``--noGUI`` to run the pipeline fully in the terminal and plot only the end\r\nresults but an assumed pattern is to load a project ``.pspj`` file from GUI.\r\n\r\nHosting and contact\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe ParSeq project is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/kklmn/ParSeq>`_.\r\nPlease use the project\u2019s Issues tab to get help or report an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
