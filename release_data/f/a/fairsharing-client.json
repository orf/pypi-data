However, there are two aspects to FAIRsharing's data that make it\ndifficult to use:\n\n1. It's licensed under the restrictive CC-BY-SA 4.0 license (\n   see https://fairsharing.org/licence). This makes it difficult to redistribute\n   the data, even in part. Better options for community reuse are CC-BY 4.0 or\n   ideally CC 0. However, keep in mind that FAIR and Open are emphatically not\n   the same thing.\n2. Instead of offering a bulk download, there is an API that requires\n   authentication using JWT.\n\nWhile there's nothing wrong with JWT, it requires several steps that make\nprogrammatic access inconvenient for less seasoned programmers.\nThe `fairsharing_client` package provides a way to automatically bulk download\nall contents from the API and store them locally in a reproducible way, so you\ncan write code that relies on FAIRsharing data without having to worry about how\nto interact with its API nor redistribute its data yourself. Further,\nthis package does some preprocessing on the content to make it more useful.\n\n```python\nimport fairsharing_client as fc\n\n# Download the data and return the path of the YAML file\n# This takes about 4 minutes and gets around 4K records.\npath = fc.ensure_fairsharing()\n\n# Download the data and open it for use\ndata = fc.load_fairsharing() \n\n# Get data for a given record\nchebi_record = data[\"FAIRsharing.62qk8w\"]\n```\n\nThere are a few ways to do authentication:\n\n1. **Envionment Variables**: set the `FAIRSHARING_LOGIN`\n   and `FAIRSHARING_PASSWORD` envionrment variables\n2. **Configuration**: in the `~/.config/fairshairing.ini` file, add the\n   following configuration:\n   ```ini\n   [fairsharing]\n   login = cthoyt@gmail.com\n   password = ...\n   ```\n3. **Keyword arguments**: pass the `login` and `password` keywords to either of\n   the example functions.\n\nA reminder: this repository does NOT redistribute FAIRsharing's data, it only\nprovides code for you to get it yourself.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Installation\n\n<!-- Uncomment this section after your first ``tox -e finish``\nThe most recent release can be installed from\n[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fairsharing_client/) with:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install fairsharing_client\n```\n-->\n\nThe most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client.git\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udc50 Contributing\n\nContributions, whether filing an issue, making a pull request, or forking, are\nappreciated. See\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor more information on getting involved.\n\n## \ud83d\udc4b Attribution\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f License\n\nThe code in this package is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n### \ud83c\udf6a Cookiecutter\n\nThis package was created\nwith [@audreyfeldroy](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)'s\n[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) package\nusing [@cthoyt](https://github.com/cthoyt)'s\n[cookiecutter-snekpack](https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-snekpack)\ntemplate.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f For Developers\n\n<details>\n  <summary>See developer instructions</summary>\n\n\nThe final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making a\ncode contribution.\n\n### Development Installation\n\nTo install in development mode, use the following:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone git+https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client.git\n$ cd fairsharing-client\n$ pip install -e .\n```\n\n### \ud83e\udd7c Testing\n\nAfter cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox`, the\nunit tests in the `tests/` folder can be run reproducibly with:\n\n```shell\n$ tox\n```\n\nAdditionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit in\na [GitHub Action](https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client/actions?query=workflow%3ATests)\n.\n\n### \ud83d\udcd6 Building the Documentation\n\nThe documentation can be built locally using the following:\n\n```shell\n$ git clone git+https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client.git\n$ cd fairsharing-client\n$ tox -e docs\n$ open docs/build/html/index.html\n``` \n\nThe documentation automatically installs the package as well as the `docs`\nextra specified in the [`setup.cfg`](setup.cfg). `sphinx` plugins like `texext`\ncan be added there. Additionally, they need to be added to the\n`extensions` list in [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py).\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 Making a Release\n\nAfter installing the package in development mode and installing\n`tox` with `pip install tox`, the commands for making a new release are\ncontained within the `finish` environment in `tox.ini`. Run the following from\nthe shell:\n\n```shell\n$ tox -e finish\n```\n\nThis script does the following:\n\n1. Uses [Bump2Version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to switch the\n   version number in the `setup.cfg`,\n   `src/fairsharing_client/version.py`,\n   and [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py) to not have the `-dev`\n   suffix\n2. Packages the code in both a tar archive and a wheel\n   using [`build`](https://github.com/pypa/build)\n3. Uploads to PyPI using [`twine`](https://github.com/pypa/twine). Be sure to\n   have a `.pypirc` file configured to avoid the need for manual input at this\n   step\n4. Push to GitHub. You'll need to make a release going with the commit where the\n   version was bumped.\n5. Bump the version to the next patch. If you made big changes and want to bump\n   the version by minor, you can use `tox -e bumpversion minor` after.\n\n</details>\n\n\n",
