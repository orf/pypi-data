You can do it from your terminal\n```\n    $ pip install DyGyS\n```\nIf you already installed the package and want to  upgrade it,\nyou can type from your terminal:\n\n```\n    $ pip install DyGyS --upgrade\n```\n\n## Dependencies\nDyGyS uses the following dependencies:\n* **scipy** for optimization and root solving;\n* **numba** for fast computation of network statistics and criterion functions.\n* **numba-scipy** for fast computation of special functions such as gammaincinv and erfinv.\n\nThey can be easily installed via pip typing\n\n    $ pip install scipy\n    $ pip install numba\n    $ pip install numba-scipy\n\n\n## How-to Guidelines\nThe module containes two classes, namely UndirectedGraph and DirectedGraph.\nAn Undirected Graph is defined as a network where weights are reciprocal, i.e., $w_{ij} = w_{ji}$ where $w_{ij}$ is the network weight from node $i$ to node $j$. \nIf weights are not reciprocal, please use the DirectedGraph class.\n\n### Class Instance and Empirical Network Statistics\nTo inizialize an UndirectedGraph or DirectedGraph instance you can type:\n\n    G = UndirectedGraph(adjacency=Wij)\n    or\n    G = DirectedGraph(adjacency=Wij)\nwhere Wij is the weighted adjacency matrix in 1-D (dense) or 2-D numpy array format.\n\nAfter initializing you can already explore core network statistics such as (out-)degree, in-degree, average neighbor degree, binary clustering coefficient, (out-)strength, in-strength, average neighbor strength and weighted clustering coefficient.\nThese are available using the respective codewords:\n\n    G.degree, G.degree_in, G.annd, G.clust, G.strength, G.strength_in, G.anns, G.clust_w\n\n### Solving the models\nYou can explore the currently available models using\n    \n    G.implemented_models\nuse their names as described in this list not to incur in error messages.\n\nIn order to solve the models you need to define a *regressor matrix* $X_w$ of dimension $N_{obs} \\times k$ where $N_{obs} = N^2$ is the number of observations (equivalent to the square of the number of nodes), and $k$ is the number of exogenous variables introduced in the Gravity Specification. \nFor L-Constrained Conditional Models and Zero-Inflated models you ought to define also a regressor matrix $X_t$ for the first-stage (or topological) optimization and you can choose to fix some of the first-stage parameters.\n\nWhen ready you can choose one of the aforementioned models and solve for their parameters using\n    \n    G.solve(model= <chosen model>,exogenous_variables = X_w, selection_variables = X_t,\n        fixed_selection_parameters = <chosen fixed selection parameters>)\n\nOnce you solved the model various other attributes become visible and measures dependent solely on criterion functions are computed. These include Loglikelihood, Jacobian, Infinite Jacobian Norm, AIC, Binary AIC and BIC, available using the codewords:\n\n    G.ll, G.jacobian, G.norm, G.aic, G.aic_binary, G.bic\n\nFor further details on the .solve functions please see the documentation.\n\n\n\n### Generating the network ensemble \n\nGenerating the network ensemble is very easy. It's enough to type:\n    \n    G.gen_ensemble(n_ensemble=<wanted number of graphs>)\nThe graphs are produced using the \"default_rng\" method for discrete-valued models or using Inverse Transform Sampling for continuous-valued models.\n\nThis method returns\n\n    G.w_ensemble_matrix\nwhich is a $N_{obs} \\times N_{ensemble}$ matrix which includes all of the $N_{ensemble}$ adjacency matrices in the ensemble.\nSuch method behaves well for networks up to $ N=200 $ for $10^{4}$ ensemble graphs, no test has been done for large networks where G.w_ensemble_matrix could be limited by RAM.\n\n\n### Computing relevant measures\n\nLet's start by showing how to compute topology-related measures. \nYou can type:\n    \n    G.classification_measures(n_ensemble=<wanted number of graphs>,percentiles = (inf_p, sup_p), stats =[<list of wanted statistics>])\nThis method does not need G.w_ensemble_matrix so you can use it without generating the ensemble of weighted networks.\nThe statistics you can compute are listed in G.implemented_classifier_statistics and once you define the number of networks, the ensemble percentiles and statistics of interest, it returns\n\n    G.avg_*, G.std_*, G.percentiles_*, G.array_*\nwhere \"avg\" stands for ensemble average, \"std\" for ensemble standard deviation, \"array\" stands for the entire measures on each ensemble graph, \"percentiles\" is a tuple containing the inf_p-percentile (default 2.5) and sup_p-percentile (default 97.5) in the ensemble and * is the statistic of interest, written as in G.implemented_classifier_statistics.\n\n\nTo compute network statistics you can type:\n\n    G.netstats_measures(percentiles=(inf_p, sup_p), stats = [<list of wanted statistics>])\nThis method needs the previous computation of G.w_ensemble_matrix.\nIt computes average, standard deviation, percentiles and ensemble arrays of the network statistics of interest which can be seen in G.implemented_network_statistics.\nIt returns:\n\n    G.avg_*, G.std_*, G.percentiles_*, G.array_*\n\nTo compute the reproduction accuracy for the network statistics (introduced in [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01179)) you can type:\n    \n    G.reproduction_accuracy_s(percentiles=(inf_p,sup_p),stats=[])\nThis method needs the previous computation of G.w_ensemble_matrix.\nIt computes the fraction of nodes for which the network measure is inside a percentile CI extracted from the graph ensemble.\nIt returns\n    \n    G.RA_s\ni.e., a list of reproduction accuracies for each of the network statistics introduced via -stats- list arranged according to its order.\n\nFinally, you can compute the reproduction accuracy for the weights (introduced in [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01179)) using:\n\n    G.reproduction_accuracy_w(percentiles=(inf_p,sup_p))\nThis method needs the previous computation of G.w_ensemble_matrix.\nIt computes the fraction of empirical weights which fall inside the percentile CI interval given by the inf_p-percentile  and sup_p-percentile, extracted from the graph ensemble and it returns as the attribute \n\n    G.RA_w.\n\n## Documentation\nYou can find the complete documentation of the DyGyS library in [documentation](https://dygys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n\n## Credits\n\n*Author*:\n\n[Marzio Di Vece](https://www.imtlucca.it/it/marzio.divece) (a.k.a.
