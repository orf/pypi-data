Take, for example, creating a new VM from disk on LVM:\n\n    lvm.createLV(\"my_vg\", \"my_vm\", \"10gb\")\n    blockdevice.create_filesystem( '/dev/my_vg/my_vm')\n    #...\n\nWhat happens if `create_filesystem` fails? You'll may be left with a inconsistent filesystem on the LV. Worse, once you fix the problem and try to run this again, `createLV` will fail, because the LV is already there, so you'll have to either create the VM manually or fix your script.\n\nA context manager makes no sense in this case: you don't want to delete the LV if all operations succeed. You have to keep track of the operations you performed, and rollback if something fails. You could do that by hand, of course, but that's no fun:\n\n    with Atomic() as atomic:\n        atomic.lvm.createLV(\"my_vg\", \"my_vm\", \"10gb\")\n        blockdevice.create_filesystem( '/dev/my_vg/my_vm')\n\nNow, the LV will be deleted only *if **any** operation inside the context manager fails*. If you have multiple `atomic` calls, it will keep track of them, and rollback them in the reverse order they were executed on. \n\nWhile `Atomic` pre-packages some knowledge, `AtomicOperationSequence` is operation agnostic - it works by defining rollback functions:\n\n    def f1():\n        print \"f1 executed\"\n    \n    def reverse(f, args, kwargs):\n         if f==f1:\n             print \"f1 reversed\"\n    \n    with AtomicOperationSequence(reverse) as atomic:\n        atomic.f1()\n\nFAQ\n===\n\npybofh? What kind of name is that?\n----------------------------------\nIt's a tribute to the [Bastard Operator From Hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Operator_From_Hell) stories\n\nWhere does development happen?\n------------------------------\nhttps://github.com/goncalopp/pybofh\n",
