For artists, they display objects and convey feelings by varied colors in photos, images and drawings. For scientist, they present data by distinguishable colors in figures and graphics. However, currently most color generator softwares and websites place restrictions on users, such as can't export color palette into local individual files, don't provide invocation interfaces, relying on cloud storages, requiring registrations and networks, regional limitations and (or) collecting user's privacies.\n\nRickrack is designed for you if you are troubled by these restrictions!\n\nRickrack is a free color editor. It is designed for generating a set of harmonious colors from color wheel or elsewhere. You can share these colors with your friends, or apply them into your creative works. You can store your favorite color sets and color boards in this software, and get them at next time. What's more, you could export color sets or color depots into individual files, backup them anywhere, share them with your friends, or import them into other softwares (such as Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Krita, Pencil 2D and Clip Studio Paint). Rickrack is written in PyQt5, which performs well on Windows, Linux and other mainstream operating systems.\n\nRickrack include two parts: software and module. **The Rickrack software** is designed for generating and managing harmonious colors. **The Rickrack module** is designed for obtain colors from software in real-time and plot images combined with other modules (such as Matplotlib and Turtle).\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#table-of-content\">[-> Back to TOC <-]</a></div>\n\n# Feature\nRickrack has several features:\n* A strong and free color editor.\n* Create a set of colors from color wheel.\n* Locate a set of colors from image.\n* Derive a color board from the color set.\n* Attach the color set and color board into depot.\n* Import colors from elsewhere and manage them in depot.\n* Export colors and import it into other image processors.\n* Obtain colors through module in real-time.\n* No function limitations and no registration required.\n* ... and more!\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#table-of-content\">[-> Back to TOC <-]</a></div>\n\n# Information\n## Homepage\nhttps://eigenmiao.com/rickrack/\n\n## Repository\nhttps://github.com/eigenmiao/Rickrack\n\n## Author\n[Eigenmiao](mailto:eigenmiao@outlook.com)\n\n## Support\n[Support the Future of Rickrack!](https://eigenmiao.com/rickrack/support.html)\n\n<div align=\"right\"><a href=\"#table-of-content\">[-> Back to TOC <-]</a></div>\n\n# Installation\n## Current Release\nThe latest stable version is [v2.5.24](https://github.com/eigenmiao/Rickrack/releases/tag/v2.5.24-stable).\n\n## Download Software\nhttps://eigenmiao.com/rickrack/\n\n## Install Software\nVisit https://eigenmiao.com/rickrack/ for more information.
