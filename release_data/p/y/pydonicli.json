            "description": "# pydoni-cli\npydoni-cli is a Python library that serves as a command-line interface to custom-built tools developed by Andoni Sooklaris.\n\n## Installation [WIP]\n\nUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pydoni-cli.\n\n```bash\nmkvirtualenv myenv\nworkon myenv\ngit clone git@github.com:tsouchlarakis/pydoni-cli.git\ncd pydoni-cli\npip install -r requirements.in\npip install -e .\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nWhen pydoni-cli is installed, an executable `doni` is implicitly installed as well. This is the primary entry point to activating the custom-built tools included in each release of pydoni-cli.\n\n`doni` is an executable built on top of `click` architecture, which supports multiple layers of command-line arguments. In the context of this module, these are referred to as *major* and *minor* command names.\n\nAs an example, should the user wish to run the script `doni imessage workflow-elt`, the command is broken into components as follows:\n\n- `doni`: main executable entry point\n- `imessage`: click command group for tools that deal with iMessage data, referred to as the *major* command name\n- `workflow-elt`: specific click command to execute, referred to as the *minor* command name\n\nExecuting simpily `doni` will list all available major commands, and executing `doni {major}` will list all minor commands associated with the named major click command group. The flag `-h` or `--help` is available for all commands and will list the expectations for the chosen command's parameters, if there are any.\n\n## The App\n\nThe `doni` executable includes command-line callable syntax for each specific minor command, but it also includes an interactive command-line app built with click and PyInquirer. This app allows the user to interactively select which tool they would like to use, modify parameters for that tool, and execute it.\n\nAs a result, each tool may be called either directly:\n\n```bash\n$ doni imessage workflow-elt\n```\n\nOr via the app interface:\n\n```bash\n$ doni\nimessage  # User select via arrow keys\nworkflow-elt  # User select via arrow keys\n# Modify parameters if desired, hit 'enter' to proceed\n# Once 'enter' has been pressed, the `doni imessage workflow-elt {modified parameters if any}` command will be run\n```\n\n## License\n[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\">\n  <img src=\"graphics/logo.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 300px;\" />\n</div>\n\n\n# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),\nand this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n<!--\nPR Title Template: Release YYYYMMDD.VVV\n\n## V.V.V (YYYY-MM-DD)\n### Added\n### Modified\n### Addressed\n### Fixed\n### Removed\n-->\n\n## 0.2.5 (2021-05-12)\n### Added\n### Modified\n- Requirements\n### Addressed\n### Fixed\n### Removed\n- .github directory\n\n## 0.2.4 (2021-05-11)\n### Added\n- Integration with `pip-tools`\n### Modified\n- gitignore\n- Command `split_batch_exported_timelapse` from submodule opsys to photo\n- Module setup\n- Changelog versioning history\n### Addressed\n### Fixed\n- Backend postgres database failed command logging\n### Removed\n\n## 0.2.3 (2021-04-13)\n### Added\n### Modified\n### Addressed\n### Fixed\n### Removed\n- Removed gitignored files from git\n\n## 0.2.2 (2021-04-13)\n### Added\n- Various 'common' modules in photo workflow\n- Ellipsis handling in iMessage workflow\n### Modified\n- Code aesthetic harmony among click command python code\n- Minor folder structure updates\n- Renamed Photo 'workflow_elt' to 'workflow'\n- iMessage workflow assess untracked/modified/removed files\n- Aesthetic updates to dashboard, and several new visualizations\n### Addressed\n### Fixed\n- CLI app fixed for major/minor command compatibility (i.e. if command = `imessage workflow-elt`, then `major` = `imessage`, and `minor` = `workflow-elt`\n### Removed\n- Click commands designed to be held privately\n\n## 0.2.1 (2021-04-02)\n### Added\n- `rsync` option for backup\n- Began photo workflow.
