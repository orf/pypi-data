            "description": "# thsl (Thistle)\n### Typed Human-friendly Serialization Language\nA typed configuration language and serialization format. Imagine YAML crossed with\nProtobufs.\n\n## Example\n```\ndebug .bool: false\nname .str: My Name\ngraphics:\n\ttarget_framerate .int: 60\n\tfullscreen .bool: false\n\tresolution:\n\t\twidth .int: 1920\n\t\theight .int: 1080\n```\n\nIndentation is done via tabs only\n\nSee [sample.thsl](sample.thsl) for more.\n\n## Features\nNot finalized. Subject to change\n\n- [x] YAML like syntax\n- [x] Type safety (avoids the\n[Norway](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/) problem)\n- [x] Comments\n- [x] Trailing Commas\n- Validation\n- String templating\n- Compound Types\n  - [x] Dictionaries\n  - [x] Lists\n  - [x] Sets\n  - Tuples\n    - [x] Simple Tuples\n    - Heterogeneous Tuples\n    - Named Tuples\n  - Structs\n  - Enums\n- [x] Scalar Types\n  - [x] Bools\n  - [x] Ints\n  - [x] Floats\n    - [x] inf\n    - [x] -inf\n    - [x] nan\n    - [x] scientific notation\n  - [x] Decimals\n    - [x] inf\n    - [x] -inf\n    - [x] nan\n    - [x] scientific notation\n  - [x] Strings\n  - [x] Chars\n  - [x] Binary\n  - [x] Hexes\n  - [x] Octals\n  - [x] Base64\n    - [x] encoding\n    - [x] decoding\n  - [x] Complex numbers\n  - [x] Ranges\n    - [x] exclusive\n    - [x] inclusive\n  - [x] Dates\n  - [x] Times\n  - [x] DateTimes\n  - [x] Intervals\n  - [x] IP Addresses\n  - [x] URLs\n- Inheritance\n- Interfaces\n- Type Aliases\n- Metadata via decorators\n  - @immutable\n  - @required\n  - @optional\n  - @nullable\n- Code Generation (human-readable as well!)\n\n#### Maybe\n- YAML and JSON output\n  - conversion would be lossy unless only compatible types are used\n- YAML or JSON input\n- zlib (de)compression\n- regex\n- semantic version numbers\n- type addon system\n\n## Benefits\nWith a grammar that is powerful enough to represent most language structures from a\nvariety of languages you no longer need to maintain two sources of truth, the data and\nthe schema. YAML and JSON are great, but they usually force the code maintainers to\nstructure the data as only the most basic of types and then in the code they must\ncast/parse them to what is really needed. thsl tries to do away with that by allowing\neverything about the data to be described in one place. Then the language can consume\nthe data in one of two ways. In places where dynamically reading the data is sufficient\nthen each language can generate the relavent data structures on the fly and use it.\n\n`But what about IDE auto-complete?`\n\nTo help with that there will be full code generation that strives to be as close to the\nthsl representation as possible in the target language. This means it will be just as\nhuman-readable as anything you wrote yourself. However, with proper tooling/plugins,\neven this might not be needed.\n\nOther features like string templating will allow for reduction of repetative structures\nin the config itself.\n\nFinally, another benefit is that if this data must be consumed by multiple languages\nthen it reduces the number of places that a schema must be maintained even more! Imagine\nhaving a Python backend with an Angular frontend. They must share a set of data and both\nhave to keep their models in sync. With thsl you can decouple the data structure and\nmaintain it in one place.\n\n## Lexer TODO:\n- [ ] heterogeneous lists\n- [ ] heterogeneous tuples\n- [ ] heterogeneous sets\n- [ ] decorators\n- [ ] type aliases\n- [ ] interfaces\n\n## Parser TODO:\n- [ ] enums\n- [ ] single line dicts\n- [ ] named tuples\n\n## Compiler TODO:\n- [ ] string templating\n\n## Other TODO:\n- [ ] Finalize grammar and token structure\n- [ ] Python code generation\n- [ ] Code generation for other languages\n- [ ] Parsing for other languages\n\n\n",
