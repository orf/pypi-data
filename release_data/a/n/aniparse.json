            "description": "# Aniparse\n\nAniparse is a Python library for parsing anime video filenames. It's simple to use, and it's based on the C++\nlibrary `Anitomy <https://github.com/erengy/anitomy>` with a lot of improvement.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following filename\n\n```\n[TaigaSubs]_Toradora!_(2008)_-_01v2_-_Tiger_and_Dragon_[1280x720_H.264_FLAC][1234ABCD].mkv\nToradora! S01E03-Your Song.mkv\n```\n\ncan be parsed using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport aniparse\n\naniparse.parse('[TaigaSubs]_Toradora!_(2008)_-_01v2_-_Tiger_and_Dragon_[1280x720_H.264_FLAC][1234ABCD].mkv')\n{\n    'anime_title': 'Toradora!',\n    'anime_year': 2008,\n    'audio_term': 'FLAC',\n    'episode_number': 1,\n    'episode_title': 'Tiger and Dragon',\n    'file_checksum': '1234ABCD',\n    'file_extension': 'mkv',\n    'file_name': '[TaigaSubs]_Toradora!_(2008)_-_01v2_-_Tiger_and_Dragon_[1280x720_H.264_FLAC][1234ABCD].mkv',\n    'release_group': 'TaigaSubs',\n    'release_version': 2,\n    'video_resolution': '1280x720',\n    'video_term': 'H.264'\n}\n\naniparse.parse(\"Toradora! S01E03-Your Song.mkv\")\n{\n    'anime_season': 1,\n    'anime_season_prefix': 'S',\n    'anime_title': 'Toradora!',\n    'episode_number': 3,\n    'episode_prefix': 'E',\n    'episode_title': 'Your Song',\n    'file_extension': 'mkv',\n    'file_name': 'Toradora! S01E03-Your Song.mkv'\n}\n```\n\nThe `parse` function receives a string and returns a dictionary containing all found elements.\nIt can also receive parsing `options` and `keyword_manager`, this will be explained below.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nSuppose that we're working on the following filename:\n\n```text\n\"Aim_For_The_Top!_Gunbuster-ep1.BD(H264.FLAC.10bit)[KAA][69ECCDCF].mkv\"\n```\n\nThe filename is first stripped off of its extension and split into groups. Groups are determined by the position of\nbrackets:\n\n```text\n\"Aim_For_The_Top!_Gunbuster-ep1.BD\", \"H264.FLAC.10bit\", \"KAA\", \"69ECCDCF\"\n```\n\nEach group is then split into tokens. In our current example, the delimiter for the enclosed group is `.`, while the\nwords in other groups are separated by `_`:\n\n```text\n\"Aim\", \"For\", \"The\", \"Top!\", \"Gunbuster-ep1\", \"BD\", \"H264\", \"FLAC\", \"10bit\", \"KAA\", \"69ECCDCF\"\n```\n\nNote: the brackets and delimiter are stored as token with category `Delimiter` and `Bracket`. And each token remembers\nif it enclosed or not.\n\nOnce the tokenizer is done, the parser comes into effect.\nFirst, all tokens are compared against a set of known keywords. In this case,\nthe tokens `BD`, `H264`, `FLAC`, `10bit`, and `69ECCDCF` are recognized as keywords,\nand are assigned the category `Source`, `VideoTerm`, `AudioTerm`, `VideoResolution`, and `FileChecksum` respectively.\n\n```text\n\"Aim\", \"For\", \"The\", \"Top!\", \"Gunbuster-ep1\", \"KAA\"\n```\n\nThe next step is to look for the episode number. Each token that contains a number is analyzed. Here.\n`Gunbuster-ep1` contains number, but it doesn't match the episode number pattern. In this case,\nthe token checked againts buggy dash pattern. So, `Gunbuster-ep1` will be split into `Gunbuster` and `ep1`.\nAfter that, it will check and `ep1` is recognized as an episode number.\nThe category `EpisodeNumber` is assigned to it and the changes is saved.\n\n```text\n\"Aim\", \"For\", \"The\", \"Top!\", \"Gunbuster\", \"KAA\"\n```\n\nThe next step is to look for the anime title. The parser will try to find unknown token before the episode number and\nnot inside a bracket.\nIn this case, `Aim`, `For`, `The`, `Top!`, and `Gunbuster` are unknown tokens, they are not inside a bracket, so it\nassigned to the `AnimeTitle` category.\n\n```text\n\"KAA\"\n```\n\nthe next step is to look for the release group. The parser will try to find unknown token after the episode number and\ninside a bracket.\nIn this case, `KAA` is unknown token, and it inside a bracket, so it assigned to the `ReleaseGroup` category.\n\n```text\n```\n\nthe next step is to look for the episode title. The parser will try to find unknown token after the episode number and\nnot inside a bracket.\nIn this case, no more unknown token left, so it leave it empty\n\n```text\n```\n\nlastly, the parser will try to find any unknown token and assign it to each category or to `Others` if it is not\nrecognized.\n\n# Why should I use it?\n\nAnime video files are commonly named in a format where the anime title is followed by the episode number,\nand all the technical details are enclosed within brackets.\nHowever, fansub groups tend to use their own naming conventions,\nand the problem is more complicated than it first appears:\n\n    Element order is not always the same.\n    Technical information is not guaranteed to be enclosed.\n    Brackets and parentheses may be grouping symbols or a part of the anime/episode title.\n    Space and underscore are not the only delimiters in use.\n    A single filename may contain multiple delimiters.\n\nThere are so many cases to cover that it's simply not possible to parse all filenames solely with\nregular expressions. Aniparse tries a different approach, and it succeeds:\nIt's able to parse tens of thousands of filenames, with great accuracy.\n\n# Are there any exceptions?\n\nYes, unfortunately. Aniparse fails to identify the anime title and episode number on rare occasions,\nmostly due to bad naming conventions. See the examples below.\n\n    Arigatou.Shuffle!.Ep08.[x264.AAC][D6E43829].mkv\n\nHere, Aniparse would report that this file is the 8th episode of `Arigatou Shuffle!`, where `Arigatou` is actually the\nname of the fansub group.\n\n    Spice and Wolf 2\n\nIs this the 2nd episode of `Spice and Wolf`, or a batch release of `Spice and Wolf 2`? with a text after number, there's\nno way to know. It's up to you consider both cases.\n\n## Suggestions to fansub groups\n\nPlease consider abiding by these simple rules before deciding on your naming convention:\n\n- Don't enclose anime title, episode number and episode title within brackets. Enclose everything else, including the\n  name of your group.\n- Don't use parentheses to enclose release information; use square brackets instead. Parentheses should only be used if\n  they are a part of the anime/episode title.\n- Don't use multiple delimiters in a single filename. If possible, stick with either space or underscore.\n- Use a separator (e.g. a dash) between anime title and episode number. There are anime titles that end with a number,\n  which creates ambiguity.\n- Indicate the episode interval in batch releases.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install Aniparse, simply use pip:\n\n```commandline\npip install aniparse\n```\n\nOr download the source code and inside the source code's folder run:\n\n```commandline\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nThe `parse` function can receive the `options` parameter. E.g.:\n\n```python\n\nimport aniparse\n\naniparse_options = {'allowed_delimiters': ' '}\naniparse.parse('DRAMAtical Murder Episode 1 - Data_01_Login', options=aniparse_options)\n{\n    'anime_title': 'DRAMAtical Murder',\n    'episode_prefix': 'Episode',\n    'episode_number': '1',\n    'episode_title': 'Data_01_Login',\n    'file_name': 'DRAMAtical Murder Episode 1 - Data_01_Login'\n}\n```\n\nIf the default options had been used, the parser would have considered `_` as a delimiter and replaced it with space in\nthe episode title.\n\nThe options contain the following attributes:\n\n| **Attribute name**   | **Type**        | **Description**                                                 | **Default value** |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| allowed_delimiters   | string          | The list of character to be considered as delimiters.           | ' _.&+,&#124;'    |\n| check_title_enclosed | boolean         | Check the anime title in enclosed if no title found             | True              |\n| eps_lower_than_alt   | boolean         | Set episode number to the lowest and the alt to be the highest  | True              |\n| ignored_dash         | boolean         | If the dash in anime/episode title should be ignored or not.    | True              |\n| ignored_strings      | list of strings | A list of strings to be removed from the filename during parse. | []                |\n| keep_delimiters      | boolean         | If the delimiters should be kept or not in anime/episode title. | False             |\n| max_extension_length | integer         | Maximum extension length.                                       | 4                 |\n| title_before_episode | boolean         | If the anime title should be before the episode number or not.  | True              |\n\n## License\n*Aniparse* is licensed under [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/).\n",
