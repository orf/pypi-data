            "description": "# JaxSSO\nA framework for structural shape optimization based on automatic differentiation (AD) and the adjoint method, enabled by [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).\n\nDeveloped by [Gaoyuan Wu](https://gaoyuanwu.github.io/) @ Princeton.\n\n\nWe have a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.15409) under review where you can find details regarding this framework.\nPlease share our project with others and cite us if you find it interesting and helpful.\nCite us using:\n```bibtex\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2211.15409,\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2211.15409},\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15409},\n  author = {Wu, Gaoyuan},\n  title = {A framework for structural shape optimization based on automatic differentiation, the adjoint method and accelerated linear algebra},\n  publisher = {arXiv},\n  year = {2022},\n}\n\n```\n## Features\n* Automatic differentiation (AD): an easy and accurate way for gradient evaluation. The implementation of AD avoids deriving derivatives manually or trauncation errors from numerical differentiation.\n* Acclerated linear algebra (XLA) and just-in-time compilation: these features in JAX boost the gradient evaluation\n* Hardware acceleration: run on GPUs and TPUs for **faster** experience.\n* Form finding based on finite element analysis (FEA) and optimization theory\n\nHere is an implementation of JaxSSO to form-find a structure inspired by [Mannheim Multihalle](https://mannheim-multihalle.de/en/architecture/) using simple gradient descent. (First photo credit to Daniel Lukac)\n![alt text](https://github.com/GaoyuanWu/JaxSSO/blob/main/data/images/MannheimMultihalle.jpg)\n![alt text](https://github.com/GaoyuanWu/JaxSSO/blob/main/data/images/MM_opt.jpg)\n## Background: shape optimization\nWe consider the minimization of the ***strain energy*** by changing the **shape** of structures, which is equivalent to maximizing the stiffness and reducing the\nbending in the structure. The mathematical formulation of this problem is as follows, where no additional constraints are considered.\n$$\\text{minimize} \\quad C(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\sigma\\epsilon \\mathrm{d}V = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{f}^\\mathrm{T}\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) $$\n$$\\text{subject to: } \\quad \\mathbf{K}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) =\\mathbf{f}$$\nwhere $C$ is the compliance, which is equal to the work done by the external load; $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_d}$ is a vector of $n_d$ design variables that determine the shape of the structure; $\\sigma$, $\\epsilon$ and $V$ are the stress, strain and volume, respectively; $\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ are the generalized load vector and nodal displacement of $n$ structural nodes; $\\mathbf{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6n\\times6n}$ is the stiffness matrix. The constraint is essentially the governing equation in finite element analysis (FEA).\n\nTo implement **gradient-based optimization**, one needs to calculate $\\nabla C$. By applying the ***adjoint method***, the entry of $\\nabla C$ is as follows:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x_i}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{u}^\\mathrm{T}\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{K}}{\\partial x_i}\\mathbf{u}$$ The use of the adjoint method: i) reduces the computation complexity and ii) decouples FEA and the derivative calculation of the stiffness matrix $\\mathbf K$.\nTo get $\\nabla C$:\n1. Conduct FEA to get $\\mathbf u$\n2. Conduct sensitivity analysis to get $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{K}}{\\partial x_i}$. which is done by the module in JaxSSO called `Model_Sens.py` using AD.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Installation\nInstall it with pip: `pip install JaxSSO`\n\n### Dependencies\nJaxSSO is written in Python and requires:\n* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) >= 1.22.0.\n* [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): \"JAX is [Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd) and [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla), brought together for high-performance machine learning research.\" Please refer to [this link](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for the installation of JAX.\n* [Nlopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Nlopt is a library for nonlinear optimization.
