This is an effort to remedy that, but as I\nhaven't loads of time to invest in it, it's a pale shadow of the\noriginal.\n\nStill, shadows have power.  It can already do the initialization portion\nof a system, although items like prep, halt, suspend, etc remain,\nas do derived keys and refsets.  But one thing at a time.\n\nAs of the 0.1.0 prerelease, all that works is the basic assembly of a\nsystem from a configuration (in Python, JSON, or TOML) and it's\nsurprising how effective that actually can be.  Unfortunately error\nmessages are lightly cryptic and documentation is nonexistent, but\nmore will be coming shortly.\n",
