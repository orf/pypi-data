[Read more about this](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html) and [about Python packaging in general](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).\n\nBuilding the project requires `build`, so first:\n\n    pip install build\n\nThen to build `unmap` locally:\n\n    python -m build\n\nThe builds both `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files, either of which you can install with `pip`.\n",
