Most Myonset dependencies are provided with a base Anaconda environment (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PyQt5). \nThe only package that needs to be installed (when using Anaconda...) is pyqtgraph (installation instruction below).\n\nInstalling through Anaconda\n\nOpen the anaconda prompt (Windows: Applications / Anaconda 3 / Anaconda prompt ; Mac /linux: just start a terminal).\nFirst, install pyqtgraph:\n```\nconda install pyqtgraph\n```\n\nMost users will also need mne-python, on which we mainly rely to open and save files containing EMG data signal:\n```\npip install mne\n```\n\nFinally, install Myonset: copy folder \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmyonset_pck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 somewhere on your computer, then in anaconda prompt:\n```\npip install \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPATH_OF_DEBUT_PCK_FOLDER\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\n```\n\t\nFor instance:\n```\npip install C:\\Users\\Administrateur\\Downloads\\myonset_pck\n```\t\n\n### License\n\nMyonset is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence v3 - see COPYING file for more details.\n\n\n\n\n",
