This is the domain that is controlled by IANA.\n\n    :code:`effective_tld` - this is the full domain suffix which can be made up of 1 to many labels. The effective\n    TLD is the thing a person chooses to register a domain under and is controlled by a Registrar, or in the case of\n    private domain suffixes the company that owns the private suffix (like DuckDNS).\n\n    :code:`registrable_domain` - this is the full domain name that a person registers with a Registrar and includes the\n    effective tld.\n\n    :code:`registrable_domain_host` - this is the label of the registrable domain without the effective tld. Most people\n    call this the second level domain, but as you can see this can get confusing.\n\n    :code:`pqdn` (Partially Qualified Domain Name) - this is the  list of sub-domains not including the registrable\n    domain and the effective TLD.\n\n    :code:`fqdn` (Fully Qualified Domain Name) - this is the full list of labels.\n\nTo give an example take the FQDN :code:`test.integration.api.somedomain.co.jp`\n\n    :code:`tld` - jp\n\n    :code:`effective_tld` - co.jp\n\n    :code:`registrable_domain` - somedomain.co.jp\n\n    :code:`registrable_domain_host` - somedomain\n\n    :code:`pqdn` - test.integration.api\n\n    :code:`fqdn` - test.integration.api.somedomain.co.jp\n\n-----\nUsage\n-----\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from domain_suffixes.suffixes import Suffixes\n\n    suffixes = Suffixes(read_cache=True)\n    fqdn = \"login.mail.stuffandthings.co.uk\"\n    result = suffixes.parse(fqdn)\n    print(result.registrable_domain_host)\n\n------------------------------------------------\nHow is domain_suffixes different than tldextract\n------------------------------------------------\n\n`tldextract <https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract>`_ is a great library if you need is to parse\napart a FQDN to get it's subdomain, domain, or full suffix.\n\ndomain_suffixes adds a bit more contextual metadata about each TLD/suffix to use mostly as features in\nmachine learning projects, such as:\n\n- International TLDs in both unicode and puny code format\n- The TLD type: generic, generic-restricted, country-code, sponsored, test, infrastructure, and host_suffix (.onion)\n- The date the TLD was registered by ICANN\n- In the case of multi-label effective TLDs, is it public (owned by a Registrar) or private (owned by a private company)\n- If the TLD (or any label in the FQDN) is puny code encoded, the ascii'ification of the unicode. This can be useful for identifying registrable domains that using unicode characters that are very similar to the ascii character used by legitimate domains, a common phishing technique.\n\n----------\nTO DO List\n----------\n\n- A lot of the suffixes listed in https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat are not actually\n  recognized TLDs, but are suffixes used for Dynamic DNS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS).\n  At some point I'd like parse that information and to pull out Dynamic DNS suffixes from actual TLDs.\n\n- Probably more unit tests\n\n\n",
