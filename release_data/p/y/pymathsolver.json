Later on, I will be adding more and more features.\n\n### 1) Quadratic Equations\n\nTo import this, use the following code `from PyMathSolver import Quadratic`. To know more about a quadratic equation, use `Quadratic.definition()`.\n\nTo find the roots of a quadratic equations, you can use the `Quadratic.findRoots(a, b, c)` function where a, b, and c are the coefficients that you need to enter. At the end, it will return the 2 solutions.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2022 Aniketh Chavare\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software\nand associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction,\nincluding without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,\nsublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or\nsubstantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
