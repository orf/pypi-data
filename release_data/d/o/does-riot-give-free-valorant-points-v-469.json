This is the easiest and quickest way to unlock all the agents in the game, but it comes at a cost. However, if you\u2019d rather pay a few dollars and unlock all the agents in the game, you should consider buying them. It\u2019s important to note, though, that you cannot buy these points in-game. You can, however, earn them through challenges, contracts, and missions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## does riot give free valorant points\r\n\r\nGet your Free Valorant Points in just a few quick steps at freecash.com! All you have to do is sign up for an account, take some paid surveys, watch videos or complete offers. You'll receive the gift card in your email after redeeming points for it!\r\n\r\n\r\nValorant releases a Battle pass every new Act. And while there is no guarantee which guns will be in the battle pass, it always gives you around 9 to 12 gun skins. These skins come in sets of 3. So there is a good chance you will get a Spectre skin. But the catch of a battle pass is just buying the battle pass won\u2019t get you the Spectre skin. You will have to grind to earn the XP needed to reach the tier where you can unlock the Spectre skin. So to sum it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n## [ does riot give free valorant points ](https://wikiredeem.com/valorant/)",
