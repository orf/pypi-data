            "description": ".. image:: atlas-direction-vectors.jpg\n\nOverview\n=========\n\nThis project contains the commands which create direction vectors for several brain regions including the cerebellum, the isocortex, and the thalamus of the AIBS P56 mouse brain.\n\nDirection vectors are 3D unit vectors associated to voxels of a brain region.\nThey represent the directions of the fiber tracts and their streamlines are assumed to cross transversely layers in laminar brain regions.\n\nDirection vectors are used in placement-algorithm to set cells orientations.\n\nDirection vectors are also used to compute placement hints (see the placement_hints module) and split layer 2/3 of the AIBS mouse isocortex.\n\nAfter installation, you can display the available command lines with the following ``bash`` command:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    atlas-direction-vectors --help\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/BlueBrain/atlas-direction-vectors\n    cd atlas-direction-vectors\n    pip install -e .\n\n\nInstructions for developers\n===========================\n\nRun the following commands before submitting your code for review:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    cd atlas-direction-vectors\n    isort -l 100 --profile black atlas_direction_vectors tests setup.py\n    black -l 100 atlas_direction_vectors tests setup.py\n\nThese formatting operations will help you pass the linting check `testenv:lint` defined in `tox.ini`.\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\n\nThe development of this software was supported by funding to the Blue Brain Project, a research center of the \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), from the Swiss government\u2019s ETH Board of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology.\n\nFor license and authors, see LICENSE.txt and AUTHORS.txt respectively.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Blue Brain Project/EPFL",
