Currently, Jupyter Server only has minor and patch versions. Different minor versions likely include API-changes while patch versions do not change API.\n\nWhen a new minor version is released on PyPI, a branch for that version will be created in this repository, and the version of the main branch will be bumped to the next minor version number. That way, the main branch always reflects the latest un-released version.\n\nTo see the changes between releases, checkout the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Usage - Running Elixir Server\n\n### Running in a local installation\n\nLaunch with:\n\n    elixir-server\n\n### Testing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.rst).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to the project, see [`CONTRIBUTING.rst`](CONTRIBUTING.rst).\n\n## License\n\n[ Licensing terms](./COPYING.md).\n",

This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.  The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/jupyter/.  ## Our Copyright Policy  Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.  With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:  # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team. # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.",
