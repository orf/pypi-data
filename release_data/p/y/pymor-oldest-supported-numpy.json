            "description": ".. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pymor-oldest-supported-numpy\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/pymor-oldest-supported-numpy/\n   :alt: PyPI\n\nAbout\n-----\n\n~~ Original Readme below of unadapted oldest-supported-numpy ~~\n\nThis is a meta-package which can be used in ``pyproject.toml`` files\nto automatically provide as a build-time dependency the oldest version\nof Numpy that supports the given Python version and platform. In case\nof platforms for which Numpy has prebuilt wheels, the provided version\nalso has a prebuilt Numpy wheel.\n\nThe reason to use the oldest available Numpy version as a build-time\ndependency is because of ABI compatibility. Binaries compiled with old\nNumpy versions are binary compatible with newer Numpy versions, but\nnot vice versa. This meta-package exists to make dealing with this\nmore convenient, without having to duplicate the same list manually in\nall packages requiring it.\n\nIn other words:\n\n.. code:: toml\n\n    [build-system]\n    requires = [\n        \"wheel\",\n        \"setuptools\",\n        \"numpy==1.13.3; python_version=='3.5'\",\n        \"numpy==1.13.3; python_version=='3.6'\",\n        \"numpy==1.14.5; python_version=='3.7'\",\n        # more numpy requirements...\n    ]\n\ncan be replaced by:\n\n.. code:: toml\n\n    [build-system]\n    requires = [\"wheel\", \"setuptools\", \"oldest-supported-numpy\"]\n\nAnd as new Python versions are released, the ``pyproject.toml`` file does not\nneed to be updated.\n\nQ&A\n---\n\nWhy define the Numpy pinnings using install_requires in this repository?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Numpy version pinnings are defined inside the ``setup.cfg`` file as\n``install_requires`` dependencies, rather than as build-time dependencies\ninside ``pyproject.toml``. This is deliberate, since Numpy is not actually\nrequired to build wheels of **oldest-supported-numpy**. What we need here\nis to make sure that when **oldest-supported-numpy** is installed into\nthe build environment of a package using it, Numpy gets installed too\nas a **runtime** dependency inside the build environment.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that since we only publish (universal)\nwheels of **oldest-supported-numpy**, the wheel contains no ``pyproject.toml``,\n``setup.cfg``, or ``setup.py`` code - it only contains metadata including\ndependencies which get installed by pip when **oldest-supported-numpy** is\ninstalled.\n\nCan I use this if my package requires a recent version of Numpy?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn many cases, even though your package may require a version of\nNumpy that is more recent than the pinned versions here, this\nis often a runtime requirement, i.e. for running (rather than\nbuilding) your package. In many cases, unless you use recent\nfeatures of the Numpy C API, you will still be able to build your\npackage with an older version of Numpy and therefore you will still\nbe able to use **oldest-supported-numpy**. You can still impose a\nmore recent Numpy requirement in ``install_requires``\n\nWhat about having a catchier name for this package?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe current name is not very catchy as package names go, but it\nis very descriptive. This package is only meant to be used in\n``pyproject.toml`` files for defining build-time dependencies,\nso it's more important to have a descriptive than a catchy name!\n\nWhat if I think that one of the pinnings is wrong or out of date?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPlease feel free to `open an issue <https://github.com/scipy/oldest-supported-numpy/issues/new>`_\nor a pull request if you think something is wrong or could be improved!\n\n\n",
