We develop FAIR, scalable, and sustainable tools for use in analyzing and managing small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data, and more.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What is SAS-tools?\n\nSAS-tools contains useful functions and classes for reading, transforming, working with, analyzing, managing, and storing SAS data (called **tools**). These tools are generic, making it easy to use and re-purpose them. Published workflows using SAS-tools can be found in the [SAS-workflows](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/SAS-workflows) repository, which can serve as examples and inspiration.\n\n## \u26a1\ufe0f Quick Start\n\nGet started with SAS-tools by installing the package from PyPI:\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install SAS-tools\n```\n\nAlternatively, build SAS-tools from source:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/SAS-tools/\ncd SAS-tools\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd16 Example Code\n\n*coming soon*\n\n## \u2696\ufe0f License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 FAIR Chemistry\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
