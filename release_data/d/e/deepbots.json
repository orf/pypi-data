            "description": "# deepbots\n\nDeepbots is a simple framework which is used as \"middleware\" between the free\nand open-source [Cyberbotics' Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) robot simulator\nand Reinforcement Learning algorithms. When it comes to Reinforcement Learning\nthe [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment has been established as\nthe most used interface between the actual application and the RL algorithm.\nDeepbots is a framework which follows the OpenAI gym environment interface\nlogic in order to be used by Webots applications.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. [Install Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installing-webots)\n   - [Windows](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installation-on-windows)\n   - [Linux](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installation-on-linux)\n   - [macOS](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installation-on-macos)\n2. [Install Python version 3.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (please\n   refer to\n   [Using Python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python#introduction)\n   to select the proper Python version for your system)\n3. Follow the [Using Python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python)\n   guide provided by Webots\n4. Webots provides a basic code editor, but if you want to use\n   [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as your IDE refer to\n   [using PyCharm IDE](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide#pycharm)\n   provided by Webots\n\nYou will probably also need a backend library to implement the neural networks,\nsuch as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or\n[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Deepbots interfaces with RL agents\nusing the OpenAI gym logic, so it can work with any backend library you choose\nto implement the agent with and any agent that already works with gym.\n\n### Install deepbots\n\nDeepbots can be installed through the package installer\n[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) running the following command:\n\n`pip install deepbots`\n\n## Official resources\n\n- On\n  [the deepbots-tutorials repository](https://github.com/aidudezzz/deepbots-tutorials)\n  you can find the official tutorials for deepbots\n- On [the deepworlds repository](https://github.com/aidudezzz/deepworlds) you\n  can find examples of deepbots being used. <br>Feel free to contribute your\n  own!\n\n## Citation\n\nConference paper (AIAI2020):\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-49186-4_6\n\n```bibtex\n@InProceedings{10.1007/978-3-030-49186-4_6,\n    author=\"Kirtas, M.\n    and Tsampazis, K.\n    and Passalis, N.\n    and Tefas, A.\",\n    editor=\"Maglogiannis, Ilias\n    and Iliadis, Lazaros\n    and Pimenidis, Elias\",\n    title=\"Deepbots: A Webots-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Robotics\",\n    booktitle=\"Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations\",\n    year=\"2020\",\n    publisher=\"Springer International Publishing\",\n    address=\"Cham\",\n    pages=\"64--75\",\n    abstract=\"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is increasingly used to train robots to perform complex and delicate tasks, while the development of realistic simulators contributes to the acceleration of research on DRL for robotics. However, it is still not straightforward to employ such simulators in the typical DRL pipeline, since their steep learning curve and the enormous amount of development required to interface with DRL methods significantly restrict their use by researchers. To overcome these limitations, in this work we present an open-source framework that combines an established interface used by DRL researchers, the OpenAI Gym interface, with the state-of-the-art Webots robot simulator in order to provide a standardized way to employ DRL in various robotics scenarios. Deepbots aims to enable researchers to easily develop DRL methods in Webots by handling all the low-level details and reducing the required development effort. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through code examples, as well as using three use cases of varying difficulty.\",\n    isbn=\"978-3-030-49186-4\"\n}\n\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nFirst of all let's set up a simple glossary:\n\n- `World`: Webots uses a tree structure to represent the different entities in\n  the scene. The World is the root entity which contains all the\n  entities/nodes. For example, the world contains the Supervisor and Robot\n  entities as well as other objects which might be included in the scene.\n\n- `Supervisor`: The Supervisor is an entity which has access to all other\n  entities of the world, while having no physical presence in it. For example,\n  the Supervisor knows the exact position of all the entities of the world and\n  can manipulate them. Additionally, the Supervisor has the Supervisor\n  Controller as one of its child nodes.\n\n- `Supervisor Controller`: The Supervisor Controller is a python script which\n  is responsible for the Supervisor. For example, in the Supervisor Controller\n  script the distance between two entities in the world can be calculated.\n\n- `Robot`: The Robot is an entity that represents a robot in the world. It\n  might have sensors and other active components, like motors, etc. as child\n  entities. Also, one of its children is the Robot Controller. For example,\n  [epuck](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck) and\n  [TIAGo](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tiago-iron) are robots.\n\n- `Robot Controller`: The Robot Controller is a python script which is\n  responsible for the Robot's movement and sensors. With the Robot Controller\n  it is possible to observe the world and act accordingly.\n- `Environment`: The Environment is the interface as described by the OpenAI\n  gym. The Environment interface has the following methods:\n\n  - `get_observations()`: Return the observations of the robot. For example,\n    metrics from sensors, a camera image etc.\n\n  - step(action): Each timestep, the agent chooses an action, and the\n    environment returns the observation, the reward and the state of the\n    problem (done or not).\n\n  - `get_reward(action)`: The reward the agent receives as a result of their\n    action.\n  - `is_done()`: Whether it\u2019s time to reset the environment. Most (but not all)\n    tasks are divided up into well-defined episodes, and done being True\n    indicates the episode has terminated. For example, if a robot has the task\n    to reach a goal, then the done condition might happen when the robot\n    \"touches\" the goal.\n  - `reset()`: Used to reset the world to the initial state.\n\nIn order to set up a task in Deepbots it is necessary to understand the\nintention of the OpenAI gym environment. According to the OpenAI gym\ndocumentation, the framework follows the classic \u201cagent-environment loop\u201d.\n\"Each timestep, the agent chooses an `action`, and the environment returns an\n`observation` and a `reward`. The process gets started by calling `reset()`,\nwhich returns an initial `observation`.\"\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidudezzz/deepbots/dev/doc/img/agent_env_loop.svg\">\n</p>\n\nDeepbots follows this exact agent-environment loop with the only difference\nbeing that the agent, which is responsible to choose an action, runs on the\nSupervisor and the observations are acquired by the robot. The goal of the\ndeepbots framework is to hide this communication from the user, especially from\nthose who are familiar with the OpenAI gym environment. More specifically,\n`SupervisorEnv` is the interface which is used by the Reinforcement Learning\nalgorithms and follows the OpenAI Gym environment logic. The Deepbots framework\nprovides different levels of abstraction according to the user's needs.\nMoreover, a goal of the framework is to provide different wrappers for a wide\nrange of robots. \n\nDeepbots also provides a default implementation of the `reset()` method,\nleveraging Webots' built-in simulation reset functions, removing the need\nfor the user to implement reset procedures for simpler use-cases. It is \nalways possible to override this method and implement any custom reset\nprocedure, as needed.\n\n#### Emitter - receiver scheme\n\nCurrently, the communication between the `Supervisor` and the\n`Robot` is achieved via an `emitter` and a `receiver`. Separating the `Supervisor`\nfrom the `Robot`, deepbots can fit a variety of use-cases, e.g. multiple\n`Robots` collecting experience and a `Supervisor` controlling them with a single\nagent. The way Webots implements `emitter`/`receiver` communication requires messages \nto be packed and unpacked, which introduces an overhead that becomes prohibiting in \nuse-cases where the observations are high-dimensional or long, such as camera images. \nDeepbots provides another partially abstract class that combines the `Supervisor` \nand the `Robot` into one controller and circumvents that issue, while being less\nflexible, which is discussed [later](#combined-robot-supervisor-scheme).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidudezzz/deepbots/dev/doc/img/deepbots_overview.png\">\n</p>\n\nOn one hand, the `emitter` is an entity which is provided by Webots, that\nbroadcasts messages to the world. On the other hand, the `receiver` is an\nentity that is used to receive messages from the `World`. Consequently, the\nagent-environment loop is transformed accordingly. Firstly, the `Robot` uses its\nsensors to retrieve the observation from the `World` and in turn uses the `emitter`\ncomponent to broadcast this observation. Secondly, the `Supervisor` receives the\nobservation via the `receiver` component and in turn, the agent uses it to choose\nan action. It should be noted that the observation the agent uses might be\nextended from the `Supervisor`. For example, a model might use LiDAR sensors\ninstalled on the `Robot`, but also the Euclidean distance between the `Robot` and\nan object. As it is expected, the `Robot` does not know the Euclidean distance,\nonly the `Supervisor` can calculate it, because it has access to all entities in\nthe `World`.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidudezzz/deepbots/dev/doc/img/workflow_diagram.png\">\n</p>\n\n#### Combined Robot-Supervisor scheme\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in use-cases where the observation transmitted between \nthe `Robot` and the `Supervisor` is high-dimensional or long, e.g. high resolution \nimages taken from a camera, a significant overhead is introduced. This is circumvented \nby inheriting and implementing the partially abstract `RobotSupervisor` that combines \nthe `Robot controller` and the `Supervisor Controller` into one, forgoing all \n`emitter`/`receiver` communication. This new controller runs on the `Robot`, but \nrequires `Supervisor` privileges and is limited to one `Robot`, one `Supervisor`.  \n\n\n### Abstraction Levels\n\nThe deepbots framework has been created mostly for educational purposes. The\naim of the framework is to enable people to use Reinforcement Learning in\nWebots. More specifically, we can consider deepbots as a wrapper of Webots\nexposing an OpenAI gym style interface. For this reason there are multiple\nlevels of abstraction. For example, a user can choose if they want to use CSV\n`emitter`/`receiver` or if they want to make an implementation from scratch. \nIn the top level of the abstraction hierarchy is the `SupervisorEnv` which is the\nOpenAI gym interface. Below that level there are partially implemented classes\nwith common functionality. These implementations aim to hide the communication \nbetween the `Supervisor` and the `Robot`, as described in the two different\nschemes ealier. Similarly, in the `emitter`/`receiver` scheme the `Robot` \nalso has different abstraction levels. According to their needs, users can choose \neither to process the messages received from the `Supervisor` themselves or \nuse the existing implementations.\n\n\n",
