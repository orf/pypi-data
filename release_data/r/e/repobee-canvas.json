            "description": "# repobee-canvas\n\nRepobee-canvas is a plugin for [RepoBee](https://github.com/repobee/repobee) to manage student git repositories using information from a \n[Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) assignment. With repobee-canvas,\nyou can upload and submit a ZIP file of a student's repository to preserve\ntheir work in Canvas.\n\n# Licence\n\nRepobee-canvas is free software. Repobee-canvas is released under the [EUPL\n1.2](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/eupl-text-eupl-12) or later.\n\n# Usage\n\nInstall and setup RepoBee by following [RepoBee's\nmanual](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/index.html). \n\n## Configure repobee-canvas\n\n1.  [Install](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/plugins.html#installing-plugins-the-install-action)\n    the `repobee-canvas` plugin. In short:\n\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/htdebeer-tue/repobee-canvas\n    repobee plugin install --local repobee-canvas\n    ```\n\n2.  Generate a Canvas API key via \"Account\", \"Settings\", \"+ New Access Token\".\n3.  Get the Canvas course id. You can find this by looking at the URL in your\n    webbrowser when you have opened the assignment.\n4.  Configure RepoBee Canvas with `repobee -p canvas config wizard`. The `-p\n    canvas` enables the Canvas plugin. This command starts the configuration\n    wizard. Choose the section \"canvas\". The wizard asks you to fill in:\n\n    - `canvas_api_key`\n    - `canvas_api_key` For example, \"https://my.canvas.com/api/v1\"\n    - `canvas_course_id`\n    - `canvas_start_assignment_message` Skip this field for now.\n\n5.  Create a CSV file to map students' Canvas IDs to their git IDs. This\n    CSV file should have at least two columns, one named\n    `canvas_id`, and the other `git_id`. More columns are allowed, even\n    recommended. For example, adding a `name` and `email` column makes looking\n    up IDs manually much easier.\n\n## Prepare and hand out the assignment\n\n1.  Prepare the assignment by running the command `repobee -p canvas prepare-assignment\n    --canvas-assignment-id XXX`. This command first checks that the Canvas\n    assignment XXX allows file uploads. If so, the command sends a welcome message to all\n    students participating in the assignment. \n\n    Sending a message to all students is needed to create a submission in\n    Canvas for each student group participating in the assignment. Without\n    this message, repobee-canvas cannot discover the students working in a group.\n\n    Furthermore, by sending a message like the default message \"This\n    assignment is managed by repobee-canvas.\", you are transparent about\n    repobee-canvas managing this assignment.\n\n    If you want to send a different message that the standard message, you can\n    either configure this globally via the config wizard, or use the\n    command-line option `--canvas-start-assignment-message`. *Note* You can\n    also use this command to send messages to Canvas submissions.\n\n2.  Generate the students file used by RepoBee. RepoBee uses the students file\n    to create a GitHub team or GitLab suborganization for groups of students\n    or individual student participating in an assignment, and then create a\n    repository for this team or sub group. \n\n    Run the command `repobee -p canvas generate-students-file\n    --canvas-assignment-id XXX --canvas-git-map YYY.csv\n    --canvas-students-file ZZZ.lst`. This generates the file\n    \"ZZZ.lst\" containing the git IDs for the students participating in the\n    assignment using the database \"YYY.csv\".\n    \n3.  Generate the student repositories. Run command `repobee -p gitlab -p\n    canvas repos setup --assignments AAA --students-file\n    ZZZ.lst --canvas-assignment-id XXX --canvas-git-map\n    YYY.csv`\n\n\n## Running the assignment\n\nI have not developed any Canvas specific functionality yet. Use RepoBee\nstandard functionality to run the assignment, like managing issues. \n\nI do plan to integrate with Canvas peer-review functionality.\n\n## Finishing  /  Clone + Upload assignment \n\nYou can run `repobe repos clone` as usual. However, if you want to upload and\nsubmit a ZIP file of the cloned student repository to Canvas, use command-line\nparameters `--canvas-upload-zip` and `--canvas-zip-name NAME`. For example,\nrun `repobee -p gitlab -p canvas repos clone --assignments AAA\n--students-file ZZZ.lst --canvas-assignment-id XXX --canvas-git-map\nYYY.csv --canvas-upload-zip --canvas-zip-name NNN`. This will clone all\nstudent repositories, zip each of the cloned repositories, and upload and\nsubmit that ZIP file as \"NNN.zip\" to the Canvas assignment.\n\n\nNote. I will write a complete manual later.\n\nRepobee-canvas is still a work in progress.",
