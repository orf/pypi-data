            "description": "# Crossroads schematization\n\nGenerate a schematization of an intersection from OpenStreetMap data.\n\n## Installation\n\nWith pip, use the following command line to install crschem:\n\n* ```pip install crossroads-schematization```\n\nDependancies:\n\nCrossroads schematization depends on ```crmodel```, that implies the following cascading dependancies:\n\n* [crossroadsdescriber](https://github.com/jeremyk6/crmodel/)\n* [crossroads-segmentation](https://github.com/jmtrivial/crossroads-segmentation)\n* OSMnx\n* NetworkX, geopandas\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you installed crossroads-schematization using pip, a console script is now available using ```get_crossroad_schematization```.\nThis script is also available in the examples folder (```PYTHONPATH=$PWD examples/get-crossroad-schematization.py```). You will find a complete description of the parameters using ```--help```.\n\n## Pipeline\n\nFirst compute for each branch two long edges *S1* and *S2* corresponding to the sidewalks:\n\n* for each edge part of a branch, identify the corresponding polyline (continue a couple of 10 meters outside of the crossing)\n* fit a long edge *E* on this polyline, starting from the beginning of the polyline (e.g. 50 meters for example), and with a fixed length in the exterior direction)\n* estimate the width of the way (using the number of lanes, the classification of the way)\n* reconstruct a linear description of the sidewalk by shifting *E* \n* if the branch is composed of more than one way, identify the two adjacent sidewalks and make them parallel\n\nEach sidewalk is part of two branches (see crossroads-description by J\u00e9r\u00e9my Kalsron), thus is described by two long edges *[Sa_i, Sa_e]* and *[Sa_i, Sa_e]* (*e* for exterior, *i* for interior).\n\n* we compute the intersection $m$ between *Sa* and *Sb*, and build a new representation with a polyline made of 3 points: *Sa_e*, *m*, *Sb_e*\n* If a one of the original segments of the crossing intersects *Sa-m-Sb*, the sidewalk is described by a polyline made of 4 points: *Sa_e*, *Sa_i*, *Sb_i*, *Sb_e*\n\nThe inner part of the crossroad is computed by assembling all the sidewalks as a closed polyline (assembling each polyline at they extremity). From this region, we can apply a negative buffer to obtain the inner part of the road (with a white space between sidewalks and inner part of the road).\n\nEach traffic island is available as a polygon from crossroads-description. We compute its compactness and size. A description is produced depending on these parameters:\n\n* if the traffic island is large, the rendering is done as if it was bordered by sidewalks\n* if the traffic island is small:\n  * if the shape is compact, we describe it by a disc\n  * if the shape is not compact, we describe it by two half discs connected by lines (a long shape)\n  \nEach pedestrian crossing is described by a dedicated pictogram, aligned with the corresponding edge from the initial data\n\n",
