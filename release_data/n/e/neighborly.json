It simulates\nthe lives of each character, their jobs, routines, relationships, and life events. Neighborly utilizes\nan entity-component system architecture, and enables users to specify custom character types, businesses,\noccupations, life events, and AI components and simulation systems.\n\nNeighborly takes lessons learned from working with\n[_Talk of the Town_](https://github.com/james-owen-ryan/talktown)\nand aims to give people better documentation, simpler interfaces, and more opportunities for extension and content authoring.\n\n<b>Neighborly is not fully functional yet. I am actively working toward a working release.</b>\n\n# Core Features\n\n* Create custom Character Archetypes and have them all interact within the same simulation\n* Create custom Business and Occupation definitions\n* Configure simulation data using YAML or in code with Python\n* Plugin architecture allows users to modularize and share their custom content\n* Low fidelity simulation simulates the macro events in character's lives (relationship milestones, job changes, victories, tragic events)\n* Export simulation state to JSON for further data processing\n\n# Tutorials and How-to Guides\n\nI plan to add these after I have finished implementing Neighborly's core\nfunctionality. I will try to align them with the sample projects, but we\nwill see how the first pre-release looks. For now, loosely refer to the\nsamples. Although, they too lag behind breaking changes to the core codebase.\n\n# Installing from PyPI\n\nNeighborly is available to install via pip.\n\n```bash\npip install neighborly\n```\n\n# Installing for local development\n\nIf you wish to download a Neighborly for local development, follow the these instructions.\n\n```bash\n# Step One: Clone Repository\ngit clone https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly.git\n\n# Step Two (Optional): Create and activate python virtual environment\ncd neighborly\n\n# For Linux and MacOS\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource ./venv/bin/activate\n\n# For Windows\npython -m venv venv\n./venv/Scripts/Activate\n\n# Step Three: Install local build and dependencies\npython -m pip install -e \".\"\n```\n\n# Running the Tests\n\nThe tests are currently out-of-date and may refer to systems\nand logic that no longer exists in Neighborly. The codebase\nchanges so frequently that it hasn't been worth the time. \nAs modules  become more established, I will add proper tests for them. \nFeel free to contribute tests by forking the repo, adding your test(s), and\nsubmitting a pull request with a description of your test cases. Your commits\nshould only contain changes to files within the `tests` directory. If you\nchange any files in other parts of the project, your PR will be rejected.\n\nPlease follow the steps below to run Neighborly's test suite. Neighborly uses\n[PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) to handle unit testing.\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Install dependencies for tests\npython -m pip install -e \".[tests]\"\n\n# Step 2: Run Pytest\npytest\n```\n\n# Running the Samples\n\nPlease follow the steps below to run the sample simulations.\nWe also have examples for using Neighborly in a IPython\nnotebook and with PyGame.\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Install dependencies for samples\npython -m pip install -e \".[samples]\"\n\n# Step 2: Run desired sample\npython ./samples/<sample_name>.py\n```\n\n# Documentation\n\nNeighborly uses [Numpy-style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) docstrings in code and full documentation can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ShiJbey/neighborly/wiki).\n\nWhen adding docstrings for existing or new bits of code please use the following\nreferences for how to format your contributions:\n\n* [Sphinx Napoleon Plugin for processing Numpy Docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html)\n* [Example Numpy Style Docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_numpy.html#example-numpy)\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to Neighborly, feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull-request. Please keep in mind that this project is a tool for creativity and learning. We have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to encourage healthy collaboration, and will enforce it if we need to.\n\n**WARNING::** This repository's structure in high flux. Parts of the code get shifted to make the APIs cleaner for use.\n\nHere are some ways that people can contribute to Neighborly:\n\n1. Proposing/Implementing new features\n2. Fixing bugs\n3. Providing optimizations\n4. Fixing typos\n5. Filing issues\n6. Contributing tutorials/how-tos to the wiki\n7. Fixing grammar and spelling in the wiki\n8. Creating new samples\n\n## Code Style\n\nNeighborly does not have a set-in-stone code style yet, but I have started integrating\nisort, black, and flake8 into the development workflow in VSCode.\n\nYou can follow [these instructions](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html) for setting up both black and isort. And I found this gist helpful for getting [flake8 working in PyCharm](https://gist.github.com/tossmilestone/23139d870841a3d5cba2aea28da1a895).\n\n# Notes\n\n## Non-Deterministic Behavior\n\nThe goal of having a seeded pseudo random simulation is so that users experience deterministic behavior when using the\nsame starting seed. We try to remove all forms of non-determinism, but some slip through. The known areas are listed\nbelow. If you find any, please make a new issue with details of the behavior.\n\n* Names may not be consistent when using the same seed. Currently, names are generated\n  using [Tracery](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery). We would need to create a custom version that uses an RNG\n  instance instead of the global random module to generate names.\n\n## DMCA Statement\n\nUpon receipt of a notice alleging copyright infringement, I will take whatever action it deems\nappropriate within its sole discretion, including removal of the allegedly infringing materials.\n\nThe repo image is something fun that I made. I love _The Simpsons_, and I couldn't think of anything more neighborly\nthan Ned Flanders. If the copyright owner for _The Simpsons_ would like me to take it down,\nplease contact me.\n\nThe same takedown policy applies to any code samples inspired by TV shows, movies, and games.\n",
