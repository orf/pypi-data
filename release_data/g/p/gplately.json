            "description": "# GPlately\n\nGPlately is an object-oriented interface to common pyGPlates and PlateTectonicTools routines.\n\n![SeedPointGIF](./Notebooks/NotebookFiles/ReadMe_Files/muller19_seedpoints.gif)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [pyGPlates](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/pygplates_getting_started.html#installation)\n- [PlateTectonicTools](https://github.com/EarthByte/PlateTectonicTools)\n- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project.html#installing-shapely)\n- NumPy\n- SciPy\n- Matplotlib\n- [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html#getting-started) (for mapping)\n- Shapely\n- [Pooch](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch)\n- GeoPandas\n- netCDF4\n\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `GPlately` using the pip package manager,\n\n```python\npip install gplately\n```\n\n... you can also install the most updated version of the `GPlately` repository with pip:\n\n```python\npip install git+https://github.com/GPlates/gplately.git \n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nGPlately uses objects to accomplish a variety of common tasks. The common objects include:\n\n- `DataServer` - download rotation files and topology features from plate models on EarthByte's webDAV server\n- `PlateReconstruction` - reconstruct features, tesselate mid ocean ridges, subduction zones\n- `Points` - partition points onto plates, rotate back through time\n- `Raster` - read in NetCDF grids, interpolation, resampling\n- `PlotTopologies` - one stop shop for plotting ridges, trenches, subduction teeth\n\n\n### The `DataServer` object\n\n`GPlately`'s `DataServer` object can be used to download:\n\n- rotation models\n- topology features\n- static polygons\n- coastlines\n- continents\n- continent-ocean boundaries\n- age grids and rasters\n- geological feature data\n\nfrom assorted plate reconstruction models. These files are needed to construct most of `GPlately`'s objects. For example,\nwe can download a `rotation model`, a set of `topology features` and some `static polygons` from the [M\u00fcller et al. 2019](https://www.earthbyte.org/muller-et-al-2019-deforming-plate-reconstruction-and-seafloor-age-grids-tectonics/) \nglobal Mesozoic\u2013Cenozoic deforming plate motion model. \n\n```python\ngDownload = gplately.DataServer(\"Muller2019\")\nrotation_model, topology_features, static_polygons = gDownload.get_plate_reconstruction_files()\n```\n\n### The `PlateReconstruction` object\n\n... contains methods to reconstruct the positions of present-day feature data back through geological time. You can also use\nit to calculate plate model data like topological plate velocities, or total trench and ridge lengths per Ma! You can create\nthe object by passing a `rotation model`, a set of `topology features` and some `static polygons`: \n\n```python\nmodel = gplately.PlateReconstruction(rotation_model, topology_features, static_polygons)\n```\nLaunch the [Plate Reconstruction](./Notebooks/02-PlateReconstructions.ipynb) notebook to see more.\n\n\n### The `PlotTopologies` object\n\n... can be used to visualise reconstructed feature geometries through time. To call the object, pass a set of `continents`, \n`coastlines` and `COBs` (either as file paths or as `<pyGPlates.FeatureCollection>` objects), as well as a `PlateReconstruction`\nobject, and a reconstruction `time`. \n\n```python\ncoastlines, continents, COBs = gDownload.get_topology_geometries()\ntime = 50 #Ma\ngPlot = gplately.plot.PlotTopologies(model, time, coastlines, continents, COBs)\n```\nBelow are some continents, coastlines, COBs, ridges and transforms, trenches, subduction teeth and\nseafloor age grids plotted using `PlotTopologies`!\n\n![ReconstructionImage](./Notebooks/NotebookFiles/ReadMe_Files/plot_topologies_img.png)\n\n### The `Points` object\n\n... can be used to reconstruct the positions of geological point features and calculate their underlying plate velocities \nthrough geological time. \n\n```python\npt_lon = np.array([-107.662152, -58.082792, 17.483189, 133.674590, 80.412876])\npt_lat = np.array([48.797807, -12.654857, 11.884395, -26.415630, 31.368509])\n\n# Call the Points object: pass the PlateReconstruction object, and the latitudes and longitudes of the seed points!\ngpts = gplately.Points(model, pt_lon, pt_lat)\n```\n![PointData](./Notebooks/NotebookFiles/ReadMe_Files/surface_hotspot_plumes.png)\n\n\n### The `Raster` object\n\n...can be used to read, resample and resize assorted raster data like `netCDF4` seafloor age grids, continental grids and ETOPO\nrelief rasters. You can also reconstruct raster data back through geological time!\n\n```python\ntime = 0\nagegrid = gdownload.get_age_grid(time)\ngraster = gplately.Raster(model, array=agegrid, extent=[-180,180,-90,90])\n```\n\nBelow is a plot of the original M\u00fcller et al. (2019) age grid (L) and an age-grid resampled with the `Raster` object (R):\n\n![RasterImg](./Notebooks/NotebookFiles/ReadMe_Files/muller19_raster_resample.png)\n\n## Sample workflows\n\nTo see GPlately in action, launch a Jupyter Notebook environment and check out the [sample notebooks](./Notebooks):\n\n- [__01 - Getting Started__](./Notebooks/01-GettingStarted.ipynb): A brief overview of how to initialise GPlately's main objects\n- [__02 - Plate Reconstructions__](./Notebooks/02-PlateReconstructions.ipynb): Setting up a `PlateReconstruction` object, reconstructing geological data through time \n- [__03 - Working with Points__](./Notebooks/03-WorkingWithPoints.ipynb): Setting up a `Points` object, reconstructing seed point locations through time with.
