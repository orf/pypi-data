Changes to such parameters \npropagate downstream, pinpointing which specific data items, or\neven specific elements thereof, are affected, thereby vastly saving unnecessary \nrecalculations. *Quibbler*, therefore, facilitates hands-on interactions with data \nin ways that are not only flexible, fun and interactive, but also traceable, \nwell-documented, and highly efficient.\n\n\n## Main Features\nHere are a few of the things that *Quibbler* does:\n\n* Easily build powerful GUI-like interaction with data, without a need for callbacks \nand event listeners. \n\n* Interactive specification of inputs and overrides of parameter values.\n\n* Automatically create human-readable records of user interventions and parameter specifications.\n\n* Independently calculate, cache and validate/invalidate individual slices of heavy-to-calculate arrays. \n\n* Present a dependency graph between raw data and downstream results.  \n\n* Provide inherent undo/redo functionalities.\n\n* **_All-of-the-above using completely standard functions and programming syntax - \nthere is very little to learn to get started!_** \n\n\n## Documentations\nSee https://readthedocs.com/ for a getting-started tour and documentations.\n\n\n## Installation \n\nTo install run:\n\n`pip install pyquibbler`\n\nIf are using *Jupyter lab*, you can also add the *pyquibbler Jupyter Lab extensions*:\n\n`pip install pyquibbler_labextension`\n\nFor developers, see [here](INSTALL.md).\n\n## Credit\n\nQuibbler was created by Roy Kishony, initially implemented as a Matlab toolbox. \n\nQuibbler for Python, *pyquibbler*, was developed at the \n[Kishony lab, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://kishony.technion.ac.il/), \nby Maor Kern, Maor Kleinberger and Roy Kishony.\n\n## Related products\n\n* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)\n* [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)\n* [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets)\n* [bokeh](http://bokeh.org)\n* [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)\n* [Datashader](https://datashader.org/)\n",
