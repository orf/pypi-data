            "description": "# PyCurator\nMaking data extraction and curation as easy as py.\n\nPyCurator allows users to easily query research repositories without the trouble of reading through API\ndocumentation. Data curation is now as easy as ```$ pycurator```. Whether you want the ease of clicking\nsome buttons and getting the data or the flexibility of modifying query format, PyCurator provides a simple\nUI for quickly retrieving data that is built on top of an extensible collection of Web and API scraper classes.\n\n## Supported Repositories\nPyCurator currently supports the following repositories in the capacities listed. Authentication is only required for Kaggle,\nthough may provide runtime benefits for Dryad as rate-limiting is relaxed.\n \n\n| Repository           | Authentication                                                                               |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dataverse            |                                                                                              |\n| Dryad                | [Dryad](https://github.com/CDL-Dryad/dryad-app/blob/main/documentation/apis/api_accounts.md) |\n| Figshare             |                                                                                              |\n| Kaggle               | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#authentication)                                     |\n| OpenML               |                                                                                              |\n| Papers With Code     |                                                                                              |                \n| Zenodo               |                                                                                              |\n\nIf there's a repository that you would like to see added to the list, check out the [Contributions](#contributions) section.\n\n## Installation and use\n### Installation\nDependencies are provided in the ```requirements.txt``` file.\nIt is recommended to create a virtual environment to ensure there is no conflict with the packages\nin your current work space.\n\nPyCurator requires a Python version >= 3.10.\n\nTo run, simply paste the following commands into your terminal\n```bash\npip install pycurator\npycurator\n```\n\n### Use\n#### Repository Selection\nAfter following the commands above, you will be met with the landing page, containing licensing, funding, and \ncopyright information. Clicking ```Continue``` will bring you to the following page \n\n![Repository Selection Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbaluja/PyCurator/main/images/repo_selection.png \"Repository Selection Page\")\n\n#### Parameter Selection\nClicking on one of the repositories will bring up the respective parameters used for querying the API and \nsaving your results. Parameters will vary depending on repository selected.\n\n![Parameter Selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbaluja/PyCurator/main/images/param_selection.png \"Figshare Parameter Selection\")\n\nThese parameters are outlined as\n\n| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Save Directory | Location to save results. Defaults to \"/data/{repo_name}/{search_term}_{search_type}.json\" within PyCurator /data sub-directory. |\n| Search Terms   | Search term(s) to query. Terms should be separated with a comma, and multi-word terms should be wrapped in quotes.               |\n| Search Types   | Type of objects to query.                                                                                                        |\n\nAfter all required parameters are provided, the ```Run``` button is activated.\n\n#### Run Page\n![Run Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelbaluja/PyCurator/main/images/run_page.png \"Run Page\")\n\nThe run page provides high level status updates in the main window. These include the beginning and end\nof processes, rate-limiting issues, runtime completion, and saving confirmation. Below are real-time status updates for the \nspecific query being completed as well as a progress bar for the high level task. During tasks that have\na fixed duration, such as metadata querying or some web scraping, a fixed-length progress bar will show\nthe progression of output. During tasks that have an indeterminate duration, a cycling task bar will be \npresent to represent continued progress.\n\nAt the bottom are the navigation buttons. To avoid unnecessary queries, the ```Back``` button is unresponsive \nduring runtime, but is activated after completion. The ```Stop``` button is used to interrupt runtime and stop querying.\nAfter runtime completion or interruption, the ```Stop``` button is replaced by the ```Exit``` button, allowing you to \nsafely terminate the program.\n\n## Contributions\n### Bugs\nPlease note that as of Spring 2022, PyCurator is still undergoing active development. For any bugs or problems that you come across, open an issue that details the problem that \nyou're experiencing.\n\n### Extension\nKnow of an API that you think should be included in PyCurator? Create a Pull Request outlining\nthe API and why you think it would be beneficial, and make sure to follow the format set out\nthrough the existing Scraper classes.\n\n## Funding and acknowledgements\nThe initial development of this program was funded by the Librarians Association of The University of California (LAUC) and UC San Diego Library Research Data Curation Program (RDCP).\n\nThank you to Matt Peters, Dan LaSusa, John Chen, Joshua Weimer, and Amy Ly for their feedback during testing of early iterations of PyCurator.\n\n\n",
