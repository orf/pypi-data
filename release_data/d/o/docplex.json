The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You can model your problems by using the Python API and solve\r\nthem on the cloud with the IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization on Cloud service or on\r\nyour computer with IBM\u00ae ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.\r\n\r\nThis library is composed of 2 modules:\r\n\r\n    * IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization CPLEX Optimizer Modeling for Python - with namespace docplex.mp\r\n    * IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization CP Optimizer Modeling for Python - with namespace docplex.cp\r\n\r\nSolving with CPLEX locally requires that IBM\u00ae ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V12.8 or V12.9\r\nis installed on your machine.\r\n\r\nSolving with the IBM\u00ae Decision Optimization on Cloud service requires that you\r\nregister for an account and get the API key.\r\n\r\nThis library is `numpy` friendly.\r\n\r\n`Documentation <https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/docplex-doc>`_\r\n\r\n`Examples <https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/docplex-examples>`_\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n*  ``pip install docplex``\r\n\r\nChangelog\n---------\n\nChanged in 2.9.141:\n```````````````````\n* In ``docplex.mp``:\n   * Removed links to rawgit.com as this service is going end of life.\n   * Model.solve_lexicographic() is deprecated. This method should be used\n     to perform lexicographic solve with COS 12.8, but with COS 12.9,\n     Model.set_multi_objective() should be used for solving problems\n     with multiple objectives.\n\n* In ``docplex.cp``:\n   * Add KPIs supported by CPO Solver 12.9\n   * Update CPO parser to read KPIs section for format 12.9\n   * Add new examples with KPIs.\n\n\nChanged in 2.8.125:\n```````````````````\n* Solving with solver agent 'docloud' is deprecated. \n  Models are now preferably solved with local solver, or the python source can be submitted to DOcplexcloud solve service. \n  See https://ibm.biz/BdYhhK.\n\n* In ``docplex.mp``:\n   * solve_lexicographic is being deprecated. In a future version, a new api will be available to support multi-objectives.\n\n* In ``docplex.cp``:\n   * Fix problem with boolean indicators in no_overlap(), always_constant() and always_equal().\n   * Allow model solution to be used directly as a starting point (ignores what is not integer or interval var).\n   * Add methods domain_min(), domain_max(), domain_iterator() and domain_contains() on both CpoIntVar and CpoIntVarSolution.\n   * Default solver agent is now 'local' instead of 'docloud'. All examples modified consequently.\n\n\nChanged in 2.7.113:\n```````````````````\n\n* In ``docplex.mp``:\n   * Multiplying a constant expression by a quadratic expression raised an exception. Now returns the\n     product of the quadratic expression and the constant value.\n   * Model.solve_lexicographic() on cloud now send the previous pass solution as a MIP start (for MIP problems)\n   * The slack of quadratic constraints always returned  zero. Now returns the correct value.\n   * Accessing the dual (or slack) of a constraint that is not added to the model returned zero; now it raises an exception. A constraint must belong to a model to return a valid dual (or slack) value\n   * Range constraints with infeasible domain (i.e. lb > ub) did not fail to solve. Now they raise a modeling exception.\n   * Multiplying two absolute value expressions raised an exception. Now fixed.\n   * When using tuples in variable dictionaries, the default name generation used to generate non-LP-compliant names,\n     because of ( and ). Now the name generator formats the tuples with a \"_\" separator without parentheses.\n\n* In ``docplex.cp``:\n   * Split fzn stuff in a separate package docplex.cp.fzn\n   * Optimize construction of arrays in FZN parser\n   * Enhance FZN parser and save 30% time\n\n\nChanged in 2.6.94:\n``````````````````\n\n* In ``docplex.cp``:\n   * Allow CpoModel.add() to accept list of constraints.\n   * Fix a bug in the conversion of an array of boolean constants into CPO expression.\n   * Extend CpoModel method set_parameters() to accept a dictionary and/or optional list of updates using named arguments.\n   * Method CpoModel.set_parameters() now clone the CpoParameters object given in arguments.\n   * Add a new method CpoModel.add_parameters() that updates parameters associated to the model.\n   * Fix wrong source location (not in real model source) when CpoModel.add() is called from another docplex.cp method.\n   * When constraint auto-naming is on (in particular for refine_conflict(), searchPhases are no more included in the process.\n   * Parameters mean_UB and mean_LB are now optional in standard_deviation()\n   * CpoModel.add() checks that the added expression is limited to constraint, boolean, objective or search phase.\n   * Add documented functions slope_piecewise_linear() and coordinate__piecewise_linear() in modeler.py.\n   * Remove default configuration settings for parameters TimeLimit and Workers.\n\n\nChanged in 2.5.92:\n``````````````````\n\n* ``docplex.cli`` gains new features:\n   * option ``--details`` will display solve details as they are published on\n     DOcplexcloud.\n   * options ``--url`` and ``-key`` allow specification of credentials without\n     using a config file.\n\n* In ``docplex.cp``:\n   * Fix problem with min() and max() that did not support optional key.\n   * Add a Flatzinc parser capable of reading Minizinc Challenge problems.\n   * Move expression dependencies analysis from model to compiler side.\n   * No more constraint to have a unique name for model expressions. Compiler reallocate private names when needed.\n   * Multiple variables or expressions with the same public name is now allowed.\n   * Replace method CpoModel.get_expression() by CpoModel.get_named_expressions_dict().\n   * Make SolverProgressPanelListener work properly with Python 2\n   * Solve is automatically set to start/next loop when SolverProgressPanelListener is used.\n   * In CpoModel, add a method that allows to substitute a function by another in the whole model.\n   * Overwrite method __bool__ to avoid accidental use of CPO expressions as Python booleans.\n   * Add special cases to search for the local CP Optimizer Interactive executable.\n   * Allow methods min(), max(), min_of() and max_of() to support variable number of arguments.\n   * Allow method all_diff() to support variable number of arguments.\n   * Context parameter 'length_for_rename' is deprecated. Only length_for_alias is used.\n   * Add a method add_var() in CpoModelSolution as a shortcut to add_integer_var_solution() and add_interval_var_solution()\n   * Overwrite method __contains__() in CpoModelSolution to easily verify that a solution to a given variable is in the solution.\n   * When called on a model, export_model() and get_cpo_string() disable all model optimization options.\n\n\nChanged in 2.4.61:\n``````````````````\n\n* Both ``docplex.mp`` & ``docplex.cp``:\n   * Support for CPLEX engines 12.8. Some features of docplex2.4 are available only with engines >= 12.8.\n   * Adding new ports (AIX, plinux).\n   * Examples are now available as Zeppelin notebooks.\n\n* In ``docplex.mp``:\n   * Express a linear problem as a scikit-learn transformer by providing a numpy, a pandas or scipy matrix.\n   * Logical constraints: constraint equivalence, if-then & rshift operator.\n   * Meta-constraints: allow the use of discrete\n     linear constraints in expressions, using their truth value.\n   * Solve hook to add a method to be called at each intermediate solution.\n   * KPIS automatically published at each intermediate solution if running on docplexcloud python worker.\n   * Support for scipy coo & csr matrixes.\n   * Fixed a bug in Model.add_constraints() when passing a string instead of a list of strings.\n\n* In ``docplex.cp``:\n   * add new method run_seeds() to execute a model multiple times, available with local solver 12.8.\n   * add support of new solver infos 'SearchStatus' and 'SearchStopCause'.\n   * In method ``docplex.cp.model.CpoModel.propagate()``, add possibility to add an optional constraint to the model.\n   * add domain iterator in integer variables and integer variables solutions, allowing to get domain\n     as a list of individual integers.\n   * add possibility to identify some model variables as KPIs of the model.\n   * add abort_search() method on solver (not supported everywhere)\n   * Rework code generation to enhance performances and remove unused variables that was pointed by removed expressions.\n   * add possibility to add one or more CpoSolverListener to put some callback functions\n     when solve is started, ended, or when a solution is found.\n     Implementation is provided in new python module ``docplex.cp.solver.solver_listener`` that also contains sample\n     listeners SolverProgressPanelListener and AutoStopListener.\n   * Using parameter *context.solver.solve_with_start_next*, enable solve() method to execute a start/next loop instead\n     of standard solve. This enables, for optimization problems, usage of SolveListeners with a greater progress accuracy.\n   * Completely remove deprecated 'angel' to identify local solver.\n   * Deprecate usage of methods ``minimize()`` and ``maximize()`` on ``docplex.cp.CpoModel``. \n   * Add methods ``get_objective_bounds()`` and ``get_objective_gaps()`` in solution objects.\n\n  \n  \nChanged in 2.3.44 (2017.09):\n````````````````````````````\n\n* Module ``docplex.cp.model.solver_angel.py`` has been renamed ``solver_local.py``. \n  A shadow copy with previous name still exist to preserve ascending compatibility.\n  Module ``docplex.cp.model.config.py`` is modified to refer this new module.\n* Class ``docplex.cp.model.solver_local.SolverAngel`` has been renamed ``SolverLocal``. \n  A shadow copy with previous name still exist to preserve ascending compatibility.\n* Class ``docplex.cp.model.solver_local.AngelException`` has been renamed ``LocalSolverException``. \n  A shadow copy with previous name still exist to preserve ascending compatibility.\n* Functions logical_and() and logical_or() are able to accept a list of model boolean expressions.\n* Fix defect on allowed_assignments() and forbiden_assignments() that was wrongly converting \n  list of tupes into tuple_set.\n* Update all examples to add comments and split them in sections data / prepare / model / solve\n* Add new sched_RCPSPMM_json.py example that reads data from JSON file instead of raw data file.\n* Rename all visu examples with more explicit names.\n* Remove the object class CpoTupleSet. Tuple sets can be constructed only by calling tuple_set() method, or more\n  simply by passing directly a Python iterable of iterables when a tupleset is required \n  (in expressions allowed_assignments() and forbidden_assignments)\n* Allow logical_and() and logical_or() to accept a list of boolean expressions.\n* Add overloading of builtin functions all() and any() as other form of logical_and() and logical_or().\n* In no_overlap() and state_function(), transition matrix can be passed directly as a Python iterable of iterables of integers, \n* Editable transition matrix, created with a size only, is deprecated. However it is still available for ascending compatibility.\n* Add conditional() modeling function\n* Parameter 'AutomaticReplay' is deprecated.\n* Add get_search_status() and get_stop_cause() on object CpoSolveResult, available for solver COS12.8\n* Improved performance of ``Var.reduced_cost()`` in ``docplex.mp``.\n\nChanged in 2.2.34 (2017.07):\n````````````````````````````\n\n* Methods ``docplex.cp.model.export_model()`` and ``docplex.cp.model.import_model()``\n  have been added to respectively generate or parse a model in CPO format.\n* Methods ``docplex.cp.model.minimize()`` and ``docplex.cp.model.maximize()``\n  have been added to directly indicate an objective at model level.\n* Notebook example ``scheduling_tuto.ipynb`` contains an extensive tutorial\n  to solve scheduling problems with CP.\n* Modeling method sum() now supports sum of cumul expressions.\n* Methods ``docplex.cp.model.start_search()`` allows to start a new \n  search sequence directly from the model object.\n* When setting ``context.solver.auto_publish`` is set, and using the CPLEX\n  engine, KPIs and current objective are automatically published when the\n  script is run on DOcplexcloud Python worker.\n* When setting ``context.solver.auto_publish`` is set, and using the CP\n  engine, current objective is automatically published when the\n  script is run on DOcplexcloud Python worker.\n* ``docplex.util.environment.Environment.set_stop_callback`` and\n  ``docplex.util.environment.Environment.get_stop_callback`` are added so that\n  you can add a callback when the DOcplexcloud job is aborted.\n\n\nChanged in 2.1.28:\n``````````````````\n\n* New methods ``Model.logical_or()`` and ``Model.logical_and()`` handle\n  logical operations on binary variables.\n* DOcplex now supports CPLEX 12.7.1 and Benders decomposition. Set annotations\n  on constraints and variables using the ``benders_annotation`` property and use\n  the proper CPLEX parameters governing Benders decomposition.\n* CPLEX tutorials: in the documentation and as notebooks in the examples.\n* Fixed a bug in ``docplex.mp.solution.SolveSolution.display()`` and in \n  ``docplex.mp.solution.Model.report_kpi()`` when using unicode variable names.\n* There's now a simple command line interface for DOcplexcloud. It can be run\n  in a terminal. ``python -m docplex.cli help`` for more info. That command\n  line reads your DOcplexcloud credentials in your cplex_config.py file. It\n  allows you to submit, list, delete jobs on DOcplexcloud. The cli is available\n  in notebooks too, using the ``%docplex_cli`` magics. ``%docplex_cli help`` for\n  some help. In a notebook, credentials can be passed using `%docplex_url` and\n  `%docplex_key` magics.\n* Removing constraints in 1 call\n* Bug fixes when editing an existing model.\n* Bug fix in the relaxation mechanism when using docplexcloud.\n\n\nChanged in 2.0.15:\n``````````````````\n\n* Piecewise linear (PWL) functions are now supported. An API is now available\n  on ``docplex.mp.model`` to create PWL functions and to create constraints using these PWL functions.\n  PWL functions may be defined with breakpoints (default API) or by using slopes. Some simple arithmetic is\n  also available to build new PWL functions by adding, subtracting, or scaling existing PWL functions.\n* DOcplex has undergone a significant overhaul effort that has resulted in an average of 30-50% improvement\n  of modeling run-time performance. All parts of the API benefit from the performance improvements: creation of variables and constraints, removal of constraints, computation of sums of variables, and so on.\n* Constraints are now fully editable: \n  the expressions of a constraint can be modified.\n  Similarly, the objective expression can also be modified. This allows for complex workflows in which the model is modified after a solve and then solved again. \n* docplex is now available on Anaconda cloud and can be installed via the conda installation packager.\n  See the `IBM Anaconda home <https://anaconda.org/IBMDecisionOptimization>`_\n  CPLEX Community Edition for Python is also provided on Anaconda Cloud to get free local solving capabilities with limitations.\n* Support of ``~/.docplexrc`` configuration files for ``docplex.mp.context.Context`` is now dropped.\n  This feature has been deprecated since 1.0.0.\n* Known incompatibility: class ``docplex.mp.model.AbstractModel`` moved to ``docplex.mp.absmodel.AbstractModel``. \n  Samples using this class have been updated.\n\n\nChanged in 1.0.630:\n```````````````````\n\n* Added support for CPLEX 12.7 and Python 3.5.\n* Upgraded the DOcplexcloud client to version 1.0.202.\n* Module ``docplex.mp.advmodel`` is now officially supported. This module\n  provides support for efficient, specialized aggregator methods for large\n  models.\n* When solving on DOcplexcloud, proxies can now be specified with the\n  ``context.solver.docloud.proxies`` property.\n* When two constraints are defined with the same name, issue a warning instead of\n  a fatal exception. The last constraint defined will take over the first one in the name directory.\n* Fix ValueError when passing a pandas DataFrame as variable keys (using\n  DataFrame indexes).\n* Solution.get_values() returns a collection of variable values in one call.\n* ``docplex.mp.model`` no longer imports ``docloud.status``. Any status\n  previously initialized as ``JobSolveStatus.UNKNOWN`` is now initialized as\n  ``None``.\n* Minor improvements to notebooks and examples.\n\n",

You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
