You want to tell you that all of that is a lie. Riot is a big game developer and won't ever let such glitches exist as it will tap in with their revenue.

But in the latest version of the valorant game, this is not the most efficient way to build troops. This is mainly related to two aspects: the width of the battle and the degree of organization. Battle width is a unique concept in the valorant code series. In short, the so-called battle width refers to the width of the battlefield that a division needs to occupy in order to fully develop and give full play to all combat effectiveness. The smaller the width is, the better when the combat effectiveness of a division remains the same, because it means that you can expand more divisions on the same combat surface. If there are more regiments (more people) in a division, it will occupy a larger battle width. For example, in a battlefield with a width of 80, you can launch two divisions of 12 regiments, but only one division of 25 regiments\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will get all new valid Free valorant points codes from its result.
