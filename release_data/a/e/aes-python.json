This project is written in pure python and do not use any external libraries for the core module \"AES_Module\". The project and the code is not intended for any use outside of educational and no security can be guaranteed for any encryption and/or decryption that uses this implementation. Do also not that this is not going to be the most efficient implementation due to my limited coding skills and knowledge, but i have tried to do my best to make it as efficient as possible so it\u00b4s not to slow to work with.\n\nThis implementation of AES (Advanced Encryption Algorithm) algorithm is implemented with a number of different running modes such as ECB and CBC with more coming soon (see list below for updated information)...\n\nImplemented running modes\n---\n- [x] **ECB** - Electronic Code Book mode (For more information see ...)\n- [x] **CBC** - Cipher Block Chaining mode (For more information see ...)\n- [ ] **CFB** - Cipher Feedback mode (For more information see ...)\n- [ ] **OFB** - Output FeedBack mode (For more information see ...)\n- [ ] **CTR** - Counter mode (For more information see ...)\n- [ ] **GCM** - Galois/Counter mode (For more information see ...)\n\nMore information\n---\n...\n",
