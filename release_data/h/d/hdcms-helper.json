It contains only a few functions and lacks a nice user experience. But, if you are only interested in that, check it out.\n\nYou can see a complete list of functions (and where they are located) by running the following code. Look at the output of `help(hdc)` to get the right filename.\n\n```python\nimport hdcms_helper as hdc\nhelp(hdc)\nwith open(<filename>, 'r') as f:\n    print(f.read())\n\nhelp(hdc.regex2stats1d)\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNumpy is a necessary dependency for everything. Matplotlib and scipy are needed for `generate_example()`. opencv is required for `write_image()`.\n\n## TODO\n\nfilter function for 2d spectra to filter out peaks with large x variation\n",
