Instead of solving this by introducing fair learning algorithms directly, DEACF focuses on generating fair synthetic data, such that any downstream learner is fair. Generating fair synthetic data from unfair data - while remaining truthful to the underlying data-generating process (DGP) - is non-trivial. DECAF is a GAN-based fair synthetic data generator for tabular data. With DECAF, we embed the DGP explicitly as a structural causal model in the input layers of the generator, allowing each variable to be reconstructed conditioned on its causal parents. This procedure enables inference time debiasing, where biased edges can be strategically removed to satisfy user-defined fairness requirements.   | [DECAF: Generating Fair Synthetic Data Using Causally-Aware Generative Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12884) |\n|**privbayes**|  A differentially private method for releasing high-dimensional data. | [PrivBayes: Private Data Release via Bayesian Networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3134428)|\n|**dpgan** | Differentially Private GAN | [Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06739) |\n|**adsgan**| A conditional GAN framework that generates synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient|  [Anonymization Through Data Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks (ADS-GAN)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32167919/) |\n|**pategan**| The methos uses the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs, allowing to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees.|  [PATE-GAN: Generating Synthetic Data with Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1zk9iRqF7) |\n\n\n### Domain adaptation\n\n| Method | Description | Reference |\n|--- | --- | --- |\n|**radialgan** | Training complex machine learning models for prediction often requires a large amount of data that is not always readily available. Leveraging these external datasets from related but different sources is, therefore, an essential task if good predictive models are to be built for deployment in settings where data can be rare. RadialGAN is an approach to the problem in which multiple GAN architectures are used to learn to translate from one dataset to another, thereby allowing to augment the target dataset effectively and learning better predictive models than just the target dataset. | [RadialGAN: Leveraging multiple datasets to improve target-specific predictive models using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06403) |\n\n\n### Debug methods\n\n| Method | Description | Reference |\n|--- | --- | --- |\n|**marginal_distributions**| A differentially private method that samples from the marginal distributions of the training set|  --- |\n|**uniform_sampler**| A differentially private method that uniformly samples from the [min, max] ranges of each column.|  --- |\n|**dummy_sampler**| Resample data points from the training set|  --- |\n\n\n\n## :zap: Evaluation metrics\nThe following table contains the available evaluation metrics:\n\n- __Sanity checks__\n\n| Metric | Description| Values |\n|--- | --- | --- |\n|**data_mismatch**| Average number of columns with datatype(object, real, int) mismatch between the real and synthetic data|0: no datatype mismatch. <br/>1: complete data type mismatch between the datasets.|\n|**common_rows_proportion**| The proportion of rows in the real dataset leaked in the synthetic dataset.| 0: there are no common rows between the real and synthetic datasets. <br/> 1: all the rows in the real dataset are leaked in the synthetic dataset. |\n|**nearest_syn_neighbor_distance**| Average distance from the real data to the closest neighbor in the synthetic data|0: all the real rows are leaked in the synthetic dataset. <br/> 1: all the synthetic rows are far away from the real dataset. |\n|**close_values_probability**| The probability of close values between the real and synthetic data.| 0: there is no chance to have synthetic rows similar to the real.<br/>1 means that all the synthetic rows are similar to some real rows. |\n|**distant_values_probability**| Average distance from the real data to the closest neighbor in the synthetic data|0: no chance to have rows in the synthetic far away from the real data. <br/> 1: all the synthetic datapoints are far away from the real data. |\n\n- __Statistical tests__\n\n| Metric | Description| Values |\n|--- | --- | --- |\n|**inverse_kl_divergence**|The average inverse of the Kullback\u2013Leibler Divergence| 0: the datasets are from different distributions. <br/> 1: the datasets are from the same distribution.|\n|**ks_test**|The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test|0: the distributions are totally different. <br/>1: the distributions are identical.|\n|**chi_squared_test**|The p-value.
