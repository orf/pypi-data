            "description": "# Ground Heat Exchanger Design Toolbox\n\nA package with the novel capability of automatically selecting ground heat \nexchanger configurations based on polygonal land constraints. This package \ncontains advanced methods that are the first of their kind. The results are \nvalidated against the world renowned `GLHEPRO` (Cook 2021).\n\nThe Ground Heat Exchanger Design Toolbox (GHEDT) is a Python package that can \nquantify the short- and long-term thermal interaction in a ground heat exchanger \n(GHE). The long-term thermal response g-functions are computed live-time with \n[pygfunction][#pygfunction]. The GHEDT contains a fast monthly hybrid time step \nsimulation for prediction of heat pump entering fluid temperatures over a design \nlife. GHEDT can vary the size (or borehole height) of a specified borehole field \nto ensure the heat pump entering fluid temperature remains within specified \nbounds. GHEDT contains a novel borehole configuration selection algorithm.\n\n## Novel Design Algorithms\n\nGHEDT contains a novel design methodology for automated selection of borehole \nfields. The advanced methodology performs optimization based on a target \ndrilling depth. An integer bisection routine is utilized to quickly search \nover a unimodal domain of boreholes. GHEDT can consider available drilling and \nno-drilling zones defined as polygons. \n\nThe selection process shown below is performed in less than half a minute on an \n11th Gen Intel Core i9-11900K @ 3.50GHz. Refer to `Cook (2021)` for more \ninformation.\n\n![polygonal](images/find_bi_alternative_03.gif)\n\n## Requirements \n\nGHEDT requires at least Python 3.7 and is tested with Python 3.7 and 3.8. GHEDT \nis dependent on the following packages:\n\n- pygfunction (>=2.1)\n- numpy (>=1.19.2)\n- scipy (>=1.6.2)\n- matplotlib (>=3.3.4)\n- coolprop (>=6.4.1)\n- pandas (>=1.3.2)\n- openpyxl (>=3.0.8)\n- opencv-python (==4.5.4.58)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n**Users** - Install `ghedt` via the package installer for Python ([pip][#pip]):\n```angular2html\npip install ghedt\n```\n\n**Developers** - Clone the repository to via git:\n```angular2html\ngit clone https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt\n```\n\nSee [installation](https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) \nfor more notes on installing. See [ghedt/examples/](https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt/tree/main/ghedt/examples) \nfor usage.   \n\n## Citing GHEDT \n\nGHEDT and other related work is described in the following thesis: \n\n```angular2html\nCook, J.C. (2021). Development of Computer Programs for Fast Computation of \n    g-Functions and Automated Ground Heat Exchanger Design. Master's Thesis, \n    Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK.\n```\n\nHere is an example of a BibTeX entry:\n```angular2html\n@mastersthesis{Cook_2021,\nschool = \"{Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK}\",\nauthor = {Cook, J C.},\nlanguage = {eng},\ntitle = \"{Development of Computer Programs for Fast Computation of g-Functions \nand Automated Ground Heat Exchanger Design}\",\nyear = {2021},\n}\n```\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf there are any questions, comments or concerns please [create][#create] an \nissue, comment on an [open][#issue] issue, comment on a [closed][#closed] issue, \nor [start][#start] a [discussion][#discussion]. \n\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThe initial release of this work (`ghedt-v0.1`) was financially supported by the \nU.S. Department of Energy through research subcontracts from Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and by OSU through the \nCenter for Integrated Building Systems, the OG&E Energy Technology Chair, and \nOklahoma State University via return of indirect costs to Dr. Jeffrey D. \nSpitler.\n\n[#pygfunction]: https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction\n[#pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/\n[#create]: https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt/issues/new\n[#issue]: https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt/issues\n[#closed]: https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed\n[#start]: https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt/discussions/new\n[#discussion]: https://github.com/j-c-cook/ghedt/discussions\n\n\n",
