If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions: (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Some features mentioned in this document are still in development and backwards compatibility is not likely to happen.***\n\n# How can I use existing `wezel` applications?\n\nYou can use `wezel` applications to visualise and analyse medical images, using a standard graphical interface much like any other medical image viewer. \n\nTo try this out, download an example application (coming soon), then double-click the file to start - no software installation required. \n\nIf you are working on a specific project, you may have been given a `wezel` application directly by a collaborator, or perhaps you found one online or as supplementary material with a publication. \n\nSome video tutorials are provided (**coming soon**) to illustrate the use of the graphical interface. The rest of this document provides detail for application developers. \n\n# How can I develop new `wezel` applications?\n\nIf you are a developer of new applications, you can use `wezel` to prototype and test your application. Once you are happy with the result, `wezel` can generate an executable which you can pass on to analysts or other users. \n\n`wezel` is distributed under an open license so you can make the executable and/or the source code publicly available, for instance as supplementary material \nin publications. \n\n## Installing wezel\n\nRun `pip install wezel`\n\n## Customizing `wezel`: menus and apps\n\nTo run `wezel` in a script, import the package, \nlaunch a new application and show it to the user:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\n\nwsl = wezel.app()      # launch an application\nwsl.show()              # show the application\n```\n\nThis will launch a dummy version of `wezel` without any functionality. \n\nThe easiest way to customize `wezel` is by replacing the menubar with a custom made one. For instance, try setting the `hello_world` menu included in the `wezel` distribution: \n\n```python\nimport wezel\n\nwsl = wezel.app()                   # launch an application\nwsl.set_menu(wezel.menus.hello_world)      # set a custom menu\nwsl.show()                          # show the application\n```\n\nOf course in practice you will be running your own menus. For instance, assume you have created a package `foo` which contains a menu definition of your own:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\nimport foo\n\nwsl = wezel.app()                  # launch an application\nwsl.set_menu(foo.mymenu)        # set a custom menu\nwsl.show()                          # show the application\n```\n\nA more useful application is the dicom.Windows app included in the `wezel` distribution. To run it, just set a different app:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\n\nwsl = wezel.app()           # launch an application\nwsl.set_app(wezel.apps.dicom.Windows)     # set a custom app\nwsl.show()                   # show the application\n```\n\nWezel also includes an app for visualising and manipulating numpy arrays (**coming soon!**):\n\n```python\nimport wezel\n\nwsl = wezel.app()           # launch an application\nwsl.set_app(wezel.apps.numpy)     # set a custom app\nwsl.show()                   # show the application\n```\n\nWhen launched in this way a window will pop up allowing the \nuser the select a dataset from disk. You can also set data interactively. Try this out by visualising an empty a 4-dimensional array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport wezel\n\nwsl = wezel.app()           # launch an application\nwsl.set_app(wezel.apps.numpy)     # set a custom app\nwsl.set_data(np.empty((10, 20, 5, 12)))\nwsl.show()                   # show the application\narray = wsl.get_data()\n```\n\nWhen calling `show()` the program halts until the user closes the window. Typically the user will have manipulated the array using the app. As shown in the example, the result can be retrieved with `get_data()`.\n\nThe tutorial contains a few other simple applications, \nbut of course you may have written your own. For instance, say you have a package `foo` that contains an app:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\nimport foo\n\nwsl = wezel.app()                # launch an application\nwsl.set_app(foo.myapp)        # set a custom app\nwsl.show()                        # show the application\n```\n\nSee below for some examples of how apps can be defined.\n\n## Writing custom `wezel` menus\n\nA menu on the `wezel` menu bar is effectively a list of menu buttons, or \"actions\" as they are called. Formally it is defined as a function which takes a parent menu or the menubar itself as argument. For instance, the Hello World menu inserted in the example above is defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef hello_world(parent):\n    hello = parent.menu('Hello')\n    hello.action(HelloWorld, text=\"Hello World\")\n```\n\nAs the example shows, a submenu of any parent menu can be created by calling `parent.menu(label)`, where `label` is the text on the menu button. \n\nThen an action can be created in any menu by calling `parent.action()` where the first argument defines the action (see below) and the (optional) `text` argument defines the text that will be shown on the button.  \n\nMore complicated menus including submenus can be created in the same way. For instance the following adds a second `HelloWorld` action and a submenu which has two other `HelloWorld` actions:\n\n```python\ndef hello_world_sub(parent):\n    hello = parent.menu('Hello')\n    hello.action(HelloWorld, text=\"Hello World\")\n    hello.action(HelloWorld, text=\"Hello World (again)\")\n    subMenu = hello.menu('Submenu')\n    subMenu.action(HelloWorld, text=\"Hello World (And again)\")\n    subMenu.action(HelloWorld, text=\"Hello World (And again!)\")\n```\n\nYou can try running this to see how it looks:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\n\nwsl = wezel.app()              # launch an application\nwsl.set_menu(hello_world_sub)   # set a custom menu\nwsl.show()                      # show the application\n```\n\n## Writing `wezel` actions\n\n`HelloWorld` as used above is an example of an action. When the user clicks on it, a window pops up carrying a title 'My first action!' and saying \"Hello World!\". \nThe program is paused until the user closes the pop-up. \nThe `HelloWorld` action is defied as follows:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\n\nclass HelloWorld(wezel.Action):\n\n    def run(self, app):\n        app.dialog.information(\"Hello World!\", title='My first action!')\n```\n\nAs the example shows, all actions in `wezel` must be defined by subclassing the `wezel.Action` class. There are no other compulsory arguments, so the following creates a functional action which does absolutely nothing when clicked:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\n\nclass DoNothing(wezel.Action):\n    pass\n```\n\nIf the `run()` function is specified, it is executed when the user clickes the menu button corresponding to the action. Apart from `self`, `run()` has a compulsory argument `app` which gives access to other relevant functionality. In the case of `HelloWorld` this is \nthe dialog class which has some options for launching pop-up windows. \n\n## Creating `wezel` executables\n\n`wezel` applications mean nothing without a simple way of distributing them as an executable, which can be run without the need for other installations by a simply mouse click. `wezel` has some built-in functionality for creating \nexecutables. As an example, imagine you have created the hello world script above:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\nimport mystuff\n\nwsl = wezel.app()                # launch an application\nwsl.set_app(mystuff.myapp)        # set a custom app\nwsl.show()                        # show the application\n```\n\nIn order to generate an executable, save the script in a separate file, for instance \"myproject.py\". You can generate an executable by calling the `build` function of `wezel` (**coming soon!**):\n\n```python\nimport wezel\nwezel.build('myproject')\n```\n\nThis must be executed from the same folder as myproject.py - as a script or interactively. After completion you will find a single file `wezel.exe` which you can distribute to the users if your applications. They will not \nneed to install anything else - just double-click and run. \n\nIf your project contains dependencies on other external packages, then these must be detailed in a text file \"requirements.txt\" as is customary for Python projects. The build function will install these along with \n`wezel`'s own dependencies. The requirements.txt file must be located in the same folder as pyproject.py.\n\nIf your project contains additional data such as images, icons or other types of files, the folders that contain these data must be provided as an additional argument to `build()`, as a list of one or more paths:\n\n```python\nimpor os\nimport wezel\n\nwezel.build('myproject', \n    data_folders = ['myimages', os.path.join('mytables','parameters')],\n    )\n```\n\nBy default the build function generates a single .exe file. As `wezel` is a graphical interface application this will not launch a terminal when the .exe file is opened. These settings are most practical for external users but for debugging purposes the terminal and a multi-file build can be more convenient. These can be created by setting the `onefile` and `terminal` keywords to `False` and `True`, \nrespectively:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\nwezel.build('myproject', \n    data_folders = ['myimages', os.path.join('mytables','parameters')],\n    terminal = True, \n    onefile = False,\n    )\n```\n\n(...) Support for hidden imports and collect data\n\n\n## Creating `wezel` apps\n\nThe graphical user interface of `wezel` is built on PyQt's \n[QMainWindow](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmainwindow.html#details), and always has a menu bar (top), a status bar (bottom), and a central widget. Applications may also use toolbars and dockwidgets if appropriate.\n\nA `wezel` app is a class that manages the content of these different components, coordinates between them and holds the data currently managed by `wezel`. In addition any `wezel` app has access to some convenience classes, such as the dialog class and progress bar which provides a convenient programming interface for common interactions with the user.\n\nAn example of a very simple (and not very useful!) `wezel` app is the `About` app which can be found in the `welcome` module of the default \n`wezel.apps`:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\n\nclass WezelAbout(wezel.App):             # Required: subclass core.App\n    def __init__(self, wzl):     # Required: initialize core.App                       \n        super().__init__(wzl)    #    with instance of `Wezel`\n\n        self.set_central(ImageLabel())          # set the central widget\n        self.set_menu(menu)                     # set the menu\n        self.set_status(\"Welcome to Wezel!\")   # display message in status bar\n```\n\nApps can be changed at runtime - for instance the following action will toggle between the About and Windows apps:\n\n```python\nimport wezel\n\nclass ToggleApp(wezel.Action):\n\n    def run(self, app):\n        \n        wzl = app.wezel\n        if app.__class__.__name__ == 'About':\n            wzl.app = wezel.apps.dicom.Windows(wzl)\n        elif app.__class__.__name__ == 'Windows':\n            wzl.app = wezel.apps.welcome.About(wzl)\n```\n\n# How can I contribute to `wezel`?\n\n**Coming soon**\n\n# About `wezel`\n\n`wezel` is a Python environment for prototyping and deploying \nquantitative medical imaging (qMRI) applications. \n\nMethod development in qMRI is hampered by a gap between scientists \nwho work with scripts or in command-line mode, \nand end-users who rely on graphical user interfaces. \n`wezel` aims to bridge that gap by providing an easy way \nto integrate pipeline scripts in an existing graphical interface \nenvironment that interfaces with DICOM databases \nand can be passed on to clinical users. \n\nThe aim is to enable a rapid feedback loop between development \nand application under real-world conditions, \nand streamline the deployment of novel methods into clinical trials. \n\n## Background\n\nEfficient, integrated product development involves an iterative \nprocess of building prototypes to test the basic ideas under \nreal-world conditions as early as possible in the product development lifecycle, \nsubsequently revising the concepts and ideas on the basis of \nthis experience, and producing improved prototypes that can \nbe tested under the same conditions again. This creates a \nrapid feedback loop between development and application that \nallows to intercept design flaws at an early stage and avoids \nexpensive and late-stage failures of novel concepts. \n\nApplied sciences such as quantitative MRI can benefit from \nan integrated product development approach, as a way of \nsteering the basic research and method development in the \ndirection most likely to produce functional real-world \napplications. In practice this is often difficult due to \nthe significant overhead required in moving from a set of \ncommand-line tools operating on computantionally convenient \nimage dataformats (nifty, numpy), to a tool that can be applied \nby clinical end users on clinical (DICOM) data in a clinical \nenvironment. \n\nHighly successful open source software tools such \nas 3D Slicer or MITK are going a long way towards bridging this \ngap, but integrating simple scripts with novel image processing \npipelines into these environments still presents a daunting task \nto basic scientists without the necessary computer science background.\n\n`wezel` aims to reduce the gap between development and \napplication of novel qMRI methods by significantly reducing the \noverhead required to integrate novel pipelines into a software \nenvironment suitable for clinical users working on clinical data. \nIt is envisioned that this will speed up the translation of new \nmethods into clinical research, and increase the value of clinical \nresearch by facilitating the integration of novel imaging biomarkers \nas secondary endpoints.\n\n## Description\n\n`wezel` is freely available via www.wezel.pro, is designed for \nopen science and therefore entirely written in Python 3 and \nreleased under an open Apache 2.0 license. \n\nSince clinical data always ultimately arrive to the developer \nand the clinical end user alike in the form of DICOM images, \n`wezel` includes a DICOM read/write programming interface. \nThe idea of this interface is to hide the complexity and inaccessible \nbureaucracy of the DICOM format from the scientist writing in Python, \ninstead providing DICOM read and write access using more intuitive \nconcepts such as folder structures, array slicing operations and \nclass attributes. This allows the developer to prototype their new \nmethods straight into DICOM, entirely removing a feared barrier to \ndeployment of novel image processing pipelines in clinical studies: \nthe need to convert pipelines interfacing with scientific data formats \ninto pipelines interfacing with DICOM. \n\nThe second important barrier to clinical translation is the need to \ninterface command-line scripts with graphical user interfaces \nallowing user intervention such as drawing or editing regions \nof interest, or performing visual quality control of medical images. \nGraphical interfaces follow an event-drive logic that is often \nunfamiliar the basic scientist and involves a steep learning \ncurve that is often prohibitive, resulting in prototypes that \nare difficult to access by clinical users and do not imitate \nthe conditions under which these tools will ultimately be deployed. \n\nWezel aims to address this challenge by providing a number \nof prepackaged graphical user interfaces with clear programming \ninterfaces that enable the integration of user-defined image \nprocessing pipelines with a simple and intuitive commands similar \nto the print or display commands typically accessed in command-line. \nUsing this approach, developers can easily configure Wezel by \ncreating customized menus and compiling those to create \napplications that can be distributed to clinical collaborators \nas independent Wezel apps. \n\nAn expanding library of graphical user \ninterface elements (widgets) for setting and accessing DICOM objects \nis also available to support the development of customised GUIs.\nWezel deployment will be supported by well-documented code base and \na series of user-friendly tutorials for clinical users.\n\n## Applications of `wezel`\n\n`wezel` development is jointly supported by the TRISTAN project \nfunded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (https://www.imi-tristan.eu/) \nand the UKRIN-MAPS project funded by the UK's Medical Research Council \n(https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/spmic/research/uk-renal-imaging-network/ukrin-maps.aspx).\n\n### TRISTAN\n\nThe TRISTAN project aims to develop imaging biomarkers for drug toxicity. \nWezel is developed by the TRISTAN work package 2 on imaging \nbiomarkers for drug toxicity, and will form the vehicle to \ndistribute an imaging biomarker assay for predicting drug-drug \ninteractions and liver toxicity. \n\nThe food and drug administration \n(FDA) has accepted a biomarker qualification letter of intent \ndescribing the assay (https://www.fda.gov/media/149415/download) \nand evidence is currently being collected to support a full \napplication for biomarker qualification. While a commercial \nassay will be taken forward by a collaborating company, Wezel \nwill be offered as a free service along with supporting data \nand SOPs for those interested to replicate the assay locally. \n\n### UKRIN-MAPS and AFiRM\n\nThe UKRIN-MAPS project provides the technical underpinnings for \na standardised multi-vendor approach to quantitative renal MRI. \nIt is a collaborative UK-based project led by Nottingham \nUniversity with support from 3 main MRI vendors. A set of \nstandardised quantitative MRI protocols has been developed \nand is currently being validated in travelling volunteer studies. \nBasic analysis algorithms are available via an open access \nlibrary (https://github.com/UKRIN-MAPS/ukat) and these are \ncurrently being wrapped up into Wezel for deployment into \nclinical trials. \n\nOne clinical trial, the AFiRM study, will use \nthese methods and has started recruiting in 2021. AFiRM will \nultimately recruit 500 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease \nwho will have 2 multi-parametric protocols 2- years apart. \nAnalysis and QC of all data will be performed in Wezel and \nfunctional pipelines have already been tested on the first datasets. \n\n## Current `wezel` version\n\nWezel is currently at version 0.2 - a prototype version \nsupporting all basic functionality that has however not been\ntried and tested under the defined context of use. \nFirst applications in 4 multi-centre renal and liver projects \nare currently under construction. Until these applications have \nprogressed to their first endpoints, Wezel is considered and \nearly prototype still subject to substantial change in the code \nbase and documenting material. A Wezel version 0.3 with a revised \nprogramming interface and simplified code base will be released shortly.\n",
